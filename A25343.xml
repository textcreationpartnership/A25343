         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>GOD, who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his</hi> (a) <hi>Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds;</hi> who after he had finiſhed the Work of Redemption for the whole <hi>(b)</hi> World of his Elect, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Heir of, that ſhould in due time partake of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo become the Children of <hi>(c)</hi> Chriſt; of which number were his Churches eſtabliſhed by the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. The Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> called the <hi>(d)</hi> Kingdom of God, the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected, which the believing <hi>Jews</hi> with the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> were Poſſeſſors of; unto whom Chriſt, the King of his Church, had given his Laws to obſerve, with his Ordinances, Miniſtry, Time, and Maintenance, till his ſecond Coming to Judgment. He was pleaſed in his Mercy and Love to his Children, to ſignify to <hi>John</hi> by his Angel, to acquaint the Churches what ſhould befall them, and the Enemies of the ſame, from the Time of his Aſcenſion unto the End of the World, in that heavenly Book of the <hi>Revelations.</hi> As (1.) in <hi>chap.</hi> 4. is ſhewed the happy Eſtate of his Church, compared to the Figure of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Tabernacle, whilſt Chriſt's glorious Throne was in the midſt of the twenty four Elders, according to the number of the twenty four Diviſions of the Prieſts and Levites by (f) <hi>David,</hi> now made a Royal <hi>(g)</hi> Prieſthood by Chriſt, enlightned with the <hi>(h)</hi> Lamps of God's Spirit. The Book that is ſealed to the <hi>(i)</hi> World, to wit, God's ſecret Counſel, is opened to this Church by the (k) <hi>Lyon of the Tribe of Juda,</hi> who only hath revealed our of the <hi>(l)</hi> Boſom of his Father all things fitting and needful for his Church to know <hi>(m)</hi> in this Life: In which Book the Words and Phraſes are generally taken out of the Prophets, and applied to the Prophecies in this heavenly Book, unto which we muſt have reſpect in the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame.

            <p n="2">2. In <hi>chap.</hi> 6 is ſhewed, How that for the Sins of the Churches, who began to revolt from the Faith once given to the Saints, which they were commanded to <hi>(a)</hi> contend for: but neglecting their <hi>(b)</hi> Watch herein, Hypocrites crept in among them, deluding them by their <hi>(c)</hi> fair Speeches, ſo deceiving the hearts of the ſimple, they ſoon embraced the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Antichriſt; for many Oppoſers of the Truth were in thoſe days. And ſo the Churches fell more and more from the Truth; as was clearly ſignified by the opening of the Seals, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. and ſounding of the Trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. So that the Sun wherewith the Church was cloathed became black as <hi>(d)</hi> Sackcloth of Hair, the Moon bloody, the Stars the Miniſters fell from the heavenly Doctrines of Faith to <hi>(e)</hi> earthly things; like unto the Doctrine of theſe times, that Men ſpeak evil of thoſe things they cannot comprehend by (f) corrupt Nature. So that the heavenly State of the Church was rolled up together as a <hi>(g)</hi> Scroll. That as God of old delivered his Church for like ſins into the hands of the old <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who deſtroyed both Temple and City, and killed many, and would not ſuffer their Bodies to be put in the <hi>(h)</hi> Grave: Even ſo did the Lord deliver the Chriſtians into the hands of the Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Harlot, who like old <hi>Babylon</hi> killed many of God's Servants, and would not ſuffer their Bodies to be put in the <hi>(i)</hi> Grave. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding though the Beaſt was ſaid in a ſenſe to overcome (k) he Saints, yet he could not, for they were with Chriſt in this War, the called, choſen and faithful <hi>(l)</hi> all the time of the thouſand Years of the Beaſts Reign, and would not worſhip the Beaſt nor his Image, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had received his Mark in their Foreheads by openly yielding unto his Canons, nor
<pb facs="tcp:108372:3"/>ſecretly in their Hands, by paying his Prieſts their duties, as they call them; but by Falth keeping the Commands of God, they lived and <hi>(m)</hi> reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years on <hi>(n)</hi> Earth: and this was in the time of the Beaſt's Reign, elſe the Praiſe given them by God's Spirit had not been properly belonging unto them, of not worſhipping the Beaſt. So that they are under a great Miſtake, that have taught from <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. that the Saints have not yet reigned with Chriſt on Earth; and how many have been deceived in this Point by them: when the Saints Reign on Earth is not after an earthly manner, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 18. is ſhewed; but over Sin, the World, and the Devil; and this is the Saints Victory, even their Faith. So ſaith <hi>Paul, I have fought the good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown</hi> (not of Gold, as ſome expect on Earth) <hi>but of Righteouſneſs and Glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (a) <hi>Jude. v.</hi> 3.

            <p n="3">3. As God of old in Wrath remembred mercy to his ancient Church, captivated in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſignified to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> there by the little Book given him to <hi>(a)</hi> eat, that he muſt propheſie again to the dry <hi>(b)</hi> Bones, to call them to Repentance, and to return and build the Temple; as was further ſignified to <hi>Zachary</hi> by a meaſuring <hi>(c)</hi> Line ſhewed him, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be built, and the Temple in it, and God's Worſhip reſtored; as, was accompliſhed in the days of <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra, Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Haggai:</hi> As their Books do ſhew at large. Even ſo did the Lord in Wrath remember Mercy to his Church, captivated by the ſpiritual <hi>Babylon.</hi> Therefore by a like Sign as was ſhewed to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſo to <hi>John,</hi> that he muſt eat the little <hi>(d)</hi> Book, ſignifying how the Lord after a thouſand years of the Beaſts Reign, would raiſe up his faithful Servants, and deliver his Captives, as was fulfilled in the end of the ſixth Seal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. and the beginning of the ſeventh, with a meaſure of <hi>John</hi>'s Spirit, to call his Elect out of the Spiritual (e) <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church, the great City which reigned over the Kings of the Earth, whoſe <hi>(f)</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſo large as ſhe reigned over all People, Kindreds, Tongues and Nations, where her Canons and Orders were obeyed. So that to the Elect among theſe muſt the Eaters of the little Book propheſy; as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did to the dry Bones that lay dead in the <hi>(g)</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Errors. So that the reſt of the dead lived not again <hi>(h)</hi> ſince their Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and their own Treſpaſſes and Sins ſince comitted in ſpiritual <hi>(i)</hi> Fornication with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Harlot, until the thouſand years Reign of the Beaſt was ended; which time of her Reign, to wit, her Ecleſiaſtical Eſtate in making Laws over Mens Conſciences, began about the year of our Lord 313, or 315. and made not an end of making Laws till about the year 1564. The Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was the laſt, wherein the Beaſt perceiving, that the Lord began to raiſe up his Servants, to ſhew all Nations deluded by her <hi>(k)</hi> Sorceries the Judgment of the great Whore, who now did gather together her Armies of <hi>(m)</hi> Locuſts in this laſt Councel, but all in vain; as was ſaid to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when God's time was come to deliver his People out of old <hi>Babylon, The Time is at hand, and the</hi> (n) <hi>Effect of every Viſion.</hi> So was it in like ſence ſaid to <hi>John, There ſhall be Time no</hi> (o) <hi>longer.</hi> But in the dayes of the Voice of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the Myſteries of God ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath declared to his Servants the Prophets. So that it appeareth the laſt great Myſtery in the Prophets before Chriſt's coming to Judgment, was to raiſe up all his Elect out of the Graves of Sin, as is this laſt reſtoring of his Church out of the ſpiritual <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo that from the time the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was divided under (p) <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> there was no Myſtery more to be obſerved from that Eſtate; as it is written, <hi>Behold, Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. but in their Captivity, and Return out of the ſame. Which ſecond Temple building anſwered this ſecond Reſtauration (as aforeſaid) in theſe laſt days. A Point worth obſerving. (a) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.3. (b) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7. (c) <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.

            <p n="4">4. The Time when the ſeventh Angel began to ſound, or the Eaters of the little Book began to propheſy, as aforeſaid, was about the year of our Lord, 1541. To mention one one or two of many, to wit, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> at that time caſting of the little Book, the Light of Gods written Word revealed by his Spirit to them, called all to come and ſee, both by their Preaching, and Printing, found out not long before the Judgment of the great Whore. So not only many of Gods Elect were enlightned, and did forſake her; but alſo Kings did begin to hate her, as God promiſed. As King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th of this Nation; who deſtroyed out of this Land the Lord Abbots and Cardinals. And after him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prince his Son, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, ſent away a great part of the Swarms of Locuſts, to wit, Jeſuits, Monks aand Friars of all ſorts, black, white and gray, and turned their Monaſteries into Hoſpitals. But as the Temple after the Captivity out of old <hi>Babylon,</hi> was forty ſix years in building, by reaſon of wicked hinderances, to wit, <hi>Tobias, Sanballer,</hi> and his Crew. So was the Lords ſpiritual Building, of which the former was a Figure, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days; until Queeen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days of happy memory, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lords Promiſe, was put into her heart, with her honourable Council; who by the authority given her, did as with a Beſom ſweep away abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thoſe poyſoned Locuſts and Scorpions, that had by the Doctrine of

Which Locuſts that came out of the bottomleſs Pit we ſhall not preſume to interpret, leſt their Brethren be angry; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope we may (without offence to any) only give you the Judgment of the learned Miniſters in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, who in the margent of the great Bibble in <hi>quarto</hi> and in <hi>folio,</hi> publiſhed by the Queens authority, have on <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.3. expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Locuſts to be falſe Teachers, Hereticks, worldly and ſubtile Prelates, with Monks, Friars, Cardinals, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Doctors; Batchelors, Maſters, that forſake Chriſt to maintain falſe Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in this Queens days the Lord, to help forward his ſpiritual Building, raiſed many famous Inſtruments. To mention one to an hundred, namely, <hi>Henry Barrow, John Greenwood, John Penry, Henry Ainſworth, John Robinſon, John Turner;</hi> who by the ſence of the little Book, which was ſweet in their mouths, but bitter in their bellies, that is, <hi>(a)</hi> wo to them if they did not publiſh the ſame, made manifeſt both by their Preaching and

               </note> VVriting, according to the golden Reed given to meaſure the ſpiritual Building, the Doctrine of the Temple, Altar and VVorſhippers. VVhich Phraſe of Temple and Altar is taken from the Prophets, the Record of the Temple built after the Captivity, which Chriſt when he was come in the fleſh taught us, it ſignified his Humanity, <hi>John</hi> 2.19, 21. <hi>God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> The <hi>(b)</hi> Altar figured the Doctrine of his Oblation and Mediation for his Church; and the whole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Temple, Altar and VVorſhippers, ſignifying the Reſtoring of the Chriſtian Religion from the Apoſtacie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; and more particularly the Temple figured Chriſt, truly profeſſed, for his Perſon and Doctrine of true Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Conſtitution of his Church therein; and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Doctrine of his Oblation, and <hi>(c)</hi> Mediation for his Church; and the VVorſhippers are faithful Chriſtians, which worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth; and not according to the appointment of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor the appointment of the Pope, but according to the appointment of the Lord Jeſus, the only Lord and Law-giver to his Church, and Arch-Biſhop of our
<pb facs="tcp:108372:4"/>Souls, contrary to the Hereſies and Abominations of Antichriſt, who together with all that obey his Orders in the ſervice of God make up one Body together, the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi> (a) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. (b) <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 12. <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.7. (c) <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
            <p>So that by theſe and the like Servants of the Lord aforeſaid, whoſe Doctrine wrought effectually in the hearts of God's Elect; ſo that there were many famous true Churches planted in this Nation, and other Parts, for whoſe ſake the Bleſſing of God promiſed was on this and other Nations; as it is written <hi>(a), I will make them, ſaith the Lord, and the Places round about my Hill, a Bleſſing; and I will cauſe the ſhower to come down in his ſeaſon, and there ſhall be ſhowers of bleſſings,</hi> inwardly and outwardly, Love to God, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him in his <hi>(b)</hi> Commands, and one to another, in neighbourly <hi>(c)</hi> Love and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; which ſweet and heavenly Work of God among Chriſtians in this Nation, the Aged that remember former days, 50 or 60 years ago or more, can witneſs to the ſame, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the want thereof now. So that when God raiſeth up his true Miniſters, to hold forth his Truth as it is in Jeſus, it did prepare all degrees to Mercies: But on the contrary, now theſe Mercies are deſpiſed, God in his juſt judgment ſendeth in his Wrath upon lukewarm Profeſſors or Chriſtians, ſtrong deluſions in the increaſe of falſe Teachers, by their Errors to prepare all Degrees that are led away by them to Judgment. And this was wofully expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced of old in the Church of <hi>(e) Iſrael,</hi> as among Chriſtians now. After the Lord had delivered them out of Captivity, &amp; had built both City and Temple, and reſtored his true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; when Chriſt came to begin his Miniſtry among them, they were ſo corrupted in thirty years time, that there was ſcarce Faith <hi>(f)</hi> found in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> (let this Age mind that) The Temple was made a Houſe of <hi>(h)</hi> Merchandiſe, God's Law made void by their Tradition, and the reſt perverted from the true <hi>(i)</hi> meaning by the gloſſe of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into divers Sects, ſome <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſome <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and ſome <hi>Herodians.</hi> And though theſe Sects were divided one againſt another, yet all could agree together againſt Chriſt, as the Pſalmiſt complained (k), They generally deſpiſed all the Counſel of Chriſt, who ſought to reclaim them, being faithleſs. They who ſeem'd to be affected with Chriſt, when Chriſt taught them the Doctrines of Faith, becauſe by Nature they could not underſtand them, they then <hi>(l)</hi> forſook him; VVhich is the general ſtate of Profeſſors now, who cannot endure any Doctrine except it ſute with their natural capacity. And in the end, the <hi>Jews</hi> with the <hi>Romans</hi> crucified him, and killed and perſecuted afterwards his Servants; for which God's Judgments haſtened on them <hi>(m)</hi> as Chriſt foretold. So that <hi>Joſephus</hi> faith, that <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> and his Souldiers deſtroyed not ſo many of them in the Siege, as the Sects in the City deſtroyed one another, who remain in diſperſion to this day; yet we believe God will call his Elect among them by what means in his Wiſdom he knoweth beſt. A fair warning for the Gentile Churches, when God will have his Controverſie with them, for their Errors in Faith, and Diſorder in Worſhip; for if God ſpared not his ancient People, but puniſhed them for their ſins, as aforeſaid, how ſhall the Gentile Churches living in their ſins think to eſcape the Judgments of God, which hang over them in this and other Nations, for their declining from the Lord's Truth ſince the laſt Reformation.

            <p>While ſome deny that heavenly Doctrine of Election, taught by the Apoſtles as a ſpecial Comfort to the hearts of God's Children; others teach the Elect may totally fall from their * Election, &amp; God's † Preſervation of them. Some teach that the everlaſting Covenant of Grace in Chriſt, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Children, to wit, that God would be a God to him and his Seed, was but a carnal Covenant. Some alſo teach that Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven, and reign a thouſand years on Earth, as an earthly Prince with the temporal Sword. Some hold and practiſe, that Men not in office of Paſtor or Teacher, may adminiſter the ordinance of Water-Baptiſm, the viſible Sign or Seal of God's Covenant in Chriſt. Some believe that the Infants of Believers have not now (as of old) right to the Sign or Seal of the Covenant; and that all Infants in the World, to wit, of Believers, <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> are in reſpect of the Promiſes of Life and Salvation in an equal State. Some believe that the Soul
<pb facs="tcp:108372:4"/>is mortal, and dieth with the Body, contrary to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.4. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.21, 22. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. Some deny the Ordinance of Singing of Pſalms in holy Scriptures, in the time of God's Worſhip, though given to the Church of God in expreſs Command by the hand of the Prophet, even to ſing the Words of <hi>Aſaph</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 29.25, 30. and never yet repealed, but commended to the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel. Others deny the holy Order of making and ordaining Miniſters by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Flock they are Members of, and over whom they muſt take care to watch for their Souls. And alſo ſome deny that Ordinance of Propheſying in the Church by thoſe of the Brethren upon whom the Lord hath beſtowed his Gifts and Graces, though not in Office. Others deny the firſt Day of the Week to be the Goſpel-Sabbath. Others hold it lawful in their Congregations, that if a Brother be deluded in his underſtanding to deny his Baptiſm in Infancy, and though he be informed by them, that there is no warrant for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing any Perſon, that was baptized before into the Name of Jeſus, than there was for re-circumciſing thoſe circumciſed in Apoſtacy; yet they yield to his Fancy rather than Faith, that he may be baptized again, and by one which calleth himſelf a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in their diſorderly Way. And now this Brother being again baptized in his own Judgment, and by his Practice doth ſay, that the Congregation he was of are all unbaptized Perſons, and that Perſon new baptized is made by his Baptiſm no more a Member of their Church; ſeeing they hold, that Perſons are made Members of true Churches by Covenant and not by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as the rebaptized ſay: Yet for all this the Congregation that allowed this Brother to be baptized, do ſtill receive him into their Communion in the Lords Supper, though they with him are all condemned in themſelves in that they have allowed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22. Two ſuch contrary Seeds or Beliefs, which in figure was forbidden to be ſowed together, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.9. in the Lords Vineyard, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.7. the Church of God, and contrary to the Doctrine of the Goſpel; as it is written, <hi>Now I beſeech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jeſus, that ye all ſpeak the ſame things, and that there be no diviſion among you; but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. So that it appears though Differences did ariſe in the Churches by reaſon of Hypocrites that did creep in among them, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. in the Apoſtles days, yet they were not ſuffered to abide unleſs they renounced their erroneous perſwaſion. See <hi>John</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7, 8, 9. * 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, to 34. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3, 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 3 48. † <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>Jer,</hi> 32.40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24.</p>
            <p>And again, what blind Watchmen have theſe Congregations, that ſee this evil of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſing, and ſound not the Trumpet againſt it, (See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.1, to. 6.) but yield that the Evil ſhall be accompliſhed. Unto ſuch a Church ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19, 20. <hi>Ye ſuffer Fools gladly, for ye ſuffer if a man bring you into bondage.</hi> Wo to ſuch blind Guides, that look more after the Fleece, or Gain from their Flock, than after the Souls whom they ſhall account for before God, to ſuffer the Church to be mixed in the Lords Plough (<hi>Deut.</hi> 22.10.) with a Ox or an Aſs together, for two ſuch contrary Judgments cannot be both clean. Yet more abominations do we ſee in theſe laſt and perillous days among the Ancients in <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 8, that are aſhamed of their hoary Heads, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.29.) and ſhave off all their Beards, which God forbiddeth (<hi>Lev.</hi> 19.27) becauſe it is one ſign in Nature to diſtinguiſh Man from Woman (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133: 2.) So that the Beard is an honour to the Man, and long hair a glory to the VVoman before her fall, which ſince ſhe muſt cover; as we have handled in a particular Treatiſe about Hair, not long ſince ſet forth, [ſo many as we have left in our hands ſhall be put at the end of this Treatiſe] to which we refer the Reader. But what Miniſters have we in this laſt Age of the VVorld, that (as aforeſaid) ſhave not only all the gray hairs of their Beards, but alſo ſhave their Heads and wear Perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs made of VVomans hair; are theſe Men Miniſters or (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.8.) Monſters, let Nature be Judg; as it is written, <hi>Doth not even Nature it ſelf teach you, that it is a ſhame for a Man to wear long hair,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.4. Are ſuch as theſe ſpiritual men, that are ignorant what is the ſhame of Nature? Surely then they would not walk ſo to be judged of man that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb facs="tcp:108372:5"/>in Nature, <hi>Man being in honour and underſtandeth not, is like the Beaſt that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> Pſal. 49.20. and ſo unfit to plow in the Lords Vineyard, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.10. Neither are ſuch good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt in the ſpiritual VVarfare of the Goſpel, that are afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thoſe of his Flock that wear Perriwigs, but rather ſmooth them up with a few ſlender reproofs, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.10.) leſt they loſe their friendſhip with the world, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch worldly Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. But if the Miniſters themſelves wear Perriwigs, as many do, then not one word againſt that odious guiſe, leſt they bid him caſt out the beam out of his own eye, and pluck off his own Perriwig, and ſo make him look like his Father <hi>Adam,</hi> with ſhort hair in his Creation, who was made very good without long hair, the ſhame of Nature. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.</p>
            <p>And again, more Diſorders abound, all ſuiting theſe laſt times to the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> in whoſe days all fleſh had corrupted their way before God; ſo that one particular is above all others named; that the Sons of God, to wit, Members of the Church, married with the Daughters of Men, that is, the World, <hi>Cain</hi>'s Poſterity, for which ſin among others the Lord ſaid, his Spirit ſhould not by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Preaching ſtrive with them any longer, but till the Ark was finiſhed, and then were they all deſtroyed. And how much differing is the ſtate of the Sons of Men now, eſpecially among the Profeſſors, who are not onely corrupted in their Faith, and Worſhip, being compared to the Primitive Pattern, but alſo in Marriages; when generally Members of ſeparated Congregations will marry thoſe with whom they will not Joyn in communion in the Lords Supper, and other ſpiritual Duties. And is not this their Practice in their own judgments ſinful in the breach of the plain Doctrine of the Apoſtle, who teacheth all Chriſtians to marry with whom they pleaſe, only in the Lord; and do not they that marry with them they refuſe viſibly to joyn with in the Church, in all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord, ſay, that ſuch are not in the Lord? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39.</p>
            <p>Yet more Abominations than theſe there are, While ſome deny the Reſurrection of the Body, and alſo deny the Scriptures to be the Rule of our Faith, preſſing men to obſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Light within. Some alſo believe that Men have free-will or power in themſelves to turn from Sin to God, contrary to <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>For theſe and the like Evils which theſe times are full of, which (ſaith the Apoſtle) will come, and is now come, <hi>that Men will not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.3. which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to Fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. in the hearts of God's Children, that is, Zeal inflamed in love to Chriſt, to follow him in the ways of his VVord, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.35.

               <p>Now followeth the Ordinance of Prophecy, being ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer, by that Member which beginneth that Exerciſe, who invocateth the Lord for a bleſſing thereon, that ſo the Gifts and Graces the Lord beſtoweth on his Church may not be <hi>(a)</hi> hid in the Earth, or <hi>(b)</hi> covered under a Buſhel, but manifeſted; as was propheſied, <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the Palm-Tree, he ſhall grow as the Cedar in Lebanon,</hi> to ſhew forth the praiſes of the Lord in his <hi>(c)</hi> Temple, obſerving time and order, ſpeaking to his glory. For this cauſe therefore hath God ordained this Ordinance, that Members not yet in office may exerciſe their Gifts, as it is written, Ye that are <hi>zealous of ſpiritual Gifts, ſeek that ye may excell to the</hi> (d) <hi>edifying of the Church;</hi> by which holy order of training up Youth or young Men in the Church, by exerciſing their Gifts, after two years time were ſome found fit in the Church of God at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to be choſen by the Church to the office of Biſhop, or Paſtor, and other offices, when as they had no office before for two years time. And thus when Gods way is taken for the fitting of Men in Gods own time and order for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, they need not, as many do, take a contrary way to make Miniſters of the Goſpel, by human art in the knowledge onely of the Tongues, as though the Gifts and Graces of God could be, as <hi>(f) Simon Magus</hi> thought, bought or purchaſed with Money; neither is it obtained by any natural Art or human Induſtry: for great is the difference beeween the attaining of the knowledge of the Tongues, and the knowledge of the Myſteries of Faith, as is evident: for the <hi>Jews</hi> were as learned Men as any in the <hi>(g)</hi> World in the knowledge of thoſe Languages the Scriptures were firſt ſpoken and wrote in, yet they knew not the <hi>(h)</hi> voices of the Prophets, when read every Sabbath, concerning Chriſt in the Promiſes, contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Writings; but when he was preached unto them out of the Writings of the Prophets, that Chriſt muſt dye for our ſins according to the <hi>(i)</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it was unto the <hi>Jews</hi> a <hi>(k)</hi> ſtumbling-block, and unto the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs. Alſo the Cardinals and Jeſuits at <hi>Rome</hi> want not the knowledg
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108372:13"/>of the Tongues, yet how ignorant are they of the Myſteries of Faith in Gods Word, and holy Order of Worſhip under the Goſpel, ſee <hi>Henry Ainſworths</hi> Arrow againſt Idolatry. So that tongues are no eſſential mark of a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as ſome men imagine; for God ſometimes called unlearned men to the Work of the Miniſtry, as <hi>(l) Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> a <hi>(m)</hi> Herdſman to be a Prophet, as well as he doth Men that are learned in the Tongues: ſo that Learning is but natural, though an excellent Ornament in Nature. And when God is pleaſed to call Men of ſuch parts in Nature, being ſanctified by the gracious work of his Spirit, to his Miniſtry, it may bring much glory to God in its place, but not that it makes Men fit for Miniſters. Now that which makes a Man a true Miniſter of Chriſt is, Firſt, being a <hi>(n)</hi> Member of the true Church of Chriſt, and by that Church called or <hi>(o)</hi> elected: when duly tried and found <hi>(p)</hi> fit both for Gifts, Grace and Qualifications, then in the time of the Ordinance of Government in the Church, by the meeteſt Members the Church thinks fit, is ordained by the conſent of the Church; and this is Chriſt's ſpiritual School that traineth up Men for the Work of this Miniſtry, in the exerciſing of the Graces the Lord beſtoweth on them; for <hi>when they ſaw the boldneſs of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and perceived that they were</hi> (q) <hi>unlearned men, they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jeſus;</hi> who when he aſcended up on high gave (r) gifts unto Men: ſo now in the ordinary Miniſtry, continued to his Church in the Office of Paſtors and Teachers, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt in the unity of the Faith, and the knowledg of the Son of God, which Knowledg is no leſs than Life eternal to them that attain to this Learning, which all the Learning in Nature comes ſhort of.

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:108372:13"/>This muſt be done with a willing <hi>(g)</hi> mind: If it be never ſo ſmall, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

And further, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Do ye not know that they which miniſter about the holy things, live of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar?

               <p>Moreover, becauſe the Church, or Kingdom of Heaven, is compared to a Draw-Net, that gathereth good and bad; to wit, ſome Hypocrites among the Elect.

               <p>Now then theſe things being ſo according as the Truth is in Jeſus; what a groſs Miſtake are ſome Men under, who call themſelves <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who have publiſhed in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> to the World, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15 preſented to King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. from theſe Words, <hi>That the Kingdoms of this World,</hi> (there ſpoken of) which ſhall <hi>become the Kingdoms of our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108372:15"/>Lord and his Chriſt's,</hi> are (ſay they) the Kingdomes of this World which men ſo mightily ſtrive after; when all know that the Kingdoms of this World, which men ſo mightily ſtrive after, are ſuch Kingdoms as <hi>England, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the like, which are governed by Civil Magiſtrates, according to Gods Ordinance, whoſe Office and Sword they have received, next under God to be Heads of their Kingdoms. Whether ſuch Magiſtrates be Believers or no, <hi>(a)</hi> yet all Chriſtians are bound to obey them, not for <hi>(b)</hi> fear, but for Conſcience ſake, and that in the Lord. (a) <hi>Acts</hi> 25.11. (b) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To help theſe Men to ſee their Miſtake in interpreting Prophecies literally, and that others may not be deceived by them, let the Reader fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, That Chriſt hath his Office next under God, to be a <hi>(a)</hi> Head and Mediator to his Church; and the Magiſtrates have their Office next under God to be Heads of their Kingdoms. Theſe two Governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both ordained of God, yet ſo diſtinct the one from the other, as they neither do nor can take in hand the Work peculiarly belonging unto one another; for which cauſe it may appear; that God divided his Laws into two Tables, the one appertaining to the worſhip and ſervice of God in his Church or Kingdom, Chriſt by it ſpiritually governing the ſame; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning temporal matters in things appertaining to this Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, which laſt Work appertaineth to the civil Magiſtrates Office: therefore would not Chriſt meddle with the <hi>(c)</hi> civil Sword in Government, <hi>(d)</hi> becauſe his Kingdom was not to be of this World, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he decide civil Controverſies <hi>(e)</hi> though deſired thereunto. (a) <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. (b) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Job</hi> 12.24. (c) <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.52. (d) <hi>John</hi> 18.36. (e) <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. On the other hand, the Kings of <hi>Judah (a)</hi> might not meddle with the Prieſts work, to burn Incenſe; yet the Magiſtrates Office, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was under Heathen Governours, might be performed by them in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bound to <hi>(b)</hi> obey them in all their Commands, according to the ſecond Table of Gods Law, as appeareth by their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>(c)</hi> Officers, judging Controverſies, and puniſhing <hi>(d)</hi> Malefactors, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bound to pray <hi>(e)</hi> for the peace of that Nation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo long as the two Tables of Gods Law remain unjoyned together; ſo long the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Kingdoms of this World, (which Chriſt's Kingdom is not of) will remain diſtinct the one from the other; for which cauſe Chriſt paid them Tribute <hi>(f),</hi> and commanded his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſo to do <hi>(g),</hi> teaching us that his Office was ſubordinate unto them in civil things, and alſo to pray for their good both in body and ſoul. And when it pleaſeth the Lord, in whoſe hands the hearts of all Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are, to turn their hearts to obey his Truth, and they become Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Church, as many Heathen Magiſtrates in the Apoſtles days
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108372:15"/>were <hi>(h);</hi> then are they ſaid to have their portion in the Holy Land; and they do bring their honour and glory, as the Gentiles their <hi>(i)</hi> riches, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Nurſing-fathers <hi>(k),</hi> preſerving the Church from outward Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, while they in Spirit and in Truth <hi>(l)</hi> worſhipthe Lord in keeping his Commandments, and ſo the <hi>(m)</hi> Earth is ſaid to help the Woman. As theſe Scriptures ſhew; (a) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16, 18. (b) <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.6, 8, 12. (c) <hi>Jer.</hi> 40.5. (d) <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.22, 23. (e) <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7.

               <p>Again, there are three Kingdoms here on Earth; firſt, the Kingdom of Magiſtratical <hi>(a)</hi> Government in Nations; ſecondly, the Kingdom or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>(b)</hi> Government of Chriſt in his Church; thirdly, the Kingdom of <hi>(c)</hi> Darkneſs, where Satan the <hi>(d)</hi> Prince of this World ruleth in the hearts of the children of <hi>(e)</hi> diſobedience. The two firſt Kingdoms or Governments are ordained of God; the third was uſurped of the Devil: The time when his Kingdom began, was ſo ſoon as Man fell by his means into <hi>(f)</hi> Sin; and thus Satan as a ſtrong Man armed took <hi>(g)</hi> poſſeſſion in our firſt Parents, until a ſtronger than he came upon him and diſpoſſeſt him, to wit Chriſt, by God promiſed to them, that the Seed of the <hi>(h)</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to wit Chriſt, ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head, and God gave them faith to believe the ſame; and thus Chriſt threw out <hi>(i),</hi> and took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in his Elect Children, whom the Father had given <hi>(k)</hi> him, to dwell in their hearts <hi>(l)</hi> by faith. Thus the War began betwixt Chriſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in Paradiſe, a figure of the <hi>(m)</hi> Church and <hi>(n)</hi> Heaven it ſelf; ſo that in a Myſtery it is written, <hi>There was War in Heaven,</hi> (o) <hi>Michael and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon: and the Dragon fought and his Angels, and prevailed not, neither was place found any more in Heaven for them.</hi> Thus Chriſt in the purpoſe of God, and in the fulneſs of time, by his death ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>(p)</hi> Principalities and Powers; as it is written, <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſt, that he might (q) deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi> Thus Chriſt by the Miniſtry of his Word, as a <hi>(r)</hi> Prophet, worketh upon the knowledge of his Elect Children, that they may diſcern Sin and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; as a Prieſt, to work upon the Will and Affections <hi>(ſ),</hi> killing them a <hi>(t)</hi> ſacrifice. Which Work of Chriſt <hi>Abel</hi> by faith ſaw, by killing the ſacrifice he was worthy to die, and by offering it up on the Altar he <hi>(u)</hi> confeſſed that Chriſt muſt die for his Sins; but <hi>Cain</hi> who was not of the number of the Elect, yet ſhewed he a form of Godlineſs, offered his <hi>(m)</hi> Sacrifice (as Hypocrites do) without faith, therefore it was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as <hi>Abel</hi>'s was, for which cauſe he <hi>(x)</hi> ſlew his Brother; ſo he is ſaid to be of that wicked One, in whoſe poſterity Satan had his Kingdom, called the World of <hi>(y)</hi> ungodly, which periſhed in the Flood, and their Spirits
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108372:16"/>remain in priſon in expectation of endleſs woe, to have their portion with him they ſerved. (a) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2.

               <p>Moreover, after the Flood Satan began his Kingdom again in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Son, <hi>Canaan</hi> the Son of <hi>Ham,</hi> whom <hi>Noah (a)</hi> curſed for his ſin of tale-bearing, who ought to have <hi>(b)</hi> concealed and not to have reproached his Father; nevertheleſs in the Field of the <hi>(c)</hi> World God hath his Elect, in whom (as aforeſaid) Satan ruleth for a while, until Chriſt by the Word of his Grace worketh Repentance in them, to the acknowledgment of the Truth, that they may be recovered out of the <hi>(d)</hi> ſnare of the Devil, captivated by him at his will. Thus we ſee the Work of Chriſt is to diſpoſſeſs Satans Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Kingdom out of the hearts of his Elect, as is opened to us in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. When Gods time was come that he would reſtore his Church by raiſing up of his Elect out of the <hi>(e)</hi> grave of ſin, wherein they lay <hi>(f)</hi> dead under the Antichriſtian Errors and Doctrines of Devils, whom the Lord <hi>(g)</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by the <hi>(h)</hi> Lightnings, and thundering Power of his Law, as was ſignified by the Temple of God being opened in Heaven, and the voices of his ſervants ſignified under the ſeventh Angel ſounding his true Doctrine out of the ſame, which cauſed ſuch an Earthquake or trembling, that ſome (like <hi>(i) Felix)</hi> trembled, yet not bettered, but were angry to have the Doctrine of eternal <hi>(k)</hi> Judgment preached againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hirlot their Mother, who had made all Nations drunk with the Wine (or ſalfe Doctrine) of her Fornication in this Earthquake. Others, like as the <hi>(m)</hi> Jaylor were converted, inſomuch that the tenth part of the City <hi>(n)</hi> fell from the belief of the Antichriſtian Errors, to believe the Doctrine of Chriſt's Temple and Altar. See the Preface to the Reader. Thus the <hi>(o)</hi> Arrows of Gods Truth, pricking the hearts of the Elect, wrought ſo effectually, that there was ſlain of Men, or Names of Men, <hi>(p)</hi> ſeven thouſand, now no more to be <hi>(q)</hi> named of the number of the Beaſt, but of the number of the <hi>(r)</hi> Names that do follow the Lord Jeſus; on ſuch is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a new <hi>(ſ)</hi> Name, even the Name of the City of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Mother of all God's Children. So that now in whom Satan had his Kingdom by ruling in them, Chriſt by faith now dwelleth and ruleth; which cauſeth the Angels (who are round about the Throne of Chriſt in his Church) to rejoyce at the converſion of poor ſinners; and ſo likewiſe do the Saints, as it is written, <hi>There were great voices in Heaven,</hi> to wit, in

               <p>Laſtly, as the <hi>(a)</hi> World knoweth not the Subjects of Chriſts Kingdom, ſo likewiſe do they not know the Kingdom it ſelf, to wit, of <hi>(b)</hi> Grace, according to the Covenant of Grace, which none but the new born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God can ſee, becauſe it is not carnal, neither cometh with outward obſervations; therefore the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> rejected Chriſt to reign over them in his ſpiritual Kingdom in his Church, as <hi>David</hi> in the Spirit fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, being a Prophet and a Figure of Chriſt in his Kingdom, which had it been of this World, terreſtrial, as <hi>David</hi>'s was, then <hi>David</hi> in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could be no figure of Chriſt, contrary to <hi>David</hi>'s Confeſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. who knowing Chriſt's Kingdom to be ſpiritual, and greater in glory than his, therefore though Chriſt was his Son, yet in ſpirit he called him his Lord, which the <hi>Jews</hi> perceived not, but withſtood it; therefore Chriſt told them the Kingdom of God ſhould be taken from them, which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not the civil Government which the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken from them already, but it was that Kingdom the Primitive Churches had received, which could not be <hi>(f)</hi> ſhaken, to wit, the Government of Chriſt in his Church, where the Laws of the King of Saints can only be <hi>(g)</hi> kept in the performance of all his holy Ordinances; whoſe Throne is among them, and his Saints round about him ſerving the Lord acceptably by Jeſus Chriſt with reverence and godly fear; unto which Kingdom the Lord is a <hi>(i)</hi> Wall of fire; <hi>for our God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is a conſuming fire.</hi> So then ſeeing the Saints have already received the Kingdom which is promiſed them on Earth, a Kingdom of Prieſts, a holy Nation; therefore vain will be the hopes of ſuch Chriſtians, that expect they ſhall be made temporal Princes on the Earth, to ride on white Horſes with golden Crowns on their Heads: they muſt be told they are miſtaken; for where Chriſt rideth on a white <hi>(m)</hi> Horſe, is meant, on the purity and powerful adminiſtration <hi>(n)</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108372:17"/>Righteouſneſs in his Church, in which work his Saints or Armies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven follow him upon white Horſes, cloathed in fine Linnen, which is the Righteouſneſs of Saints imputed from Chriſt to them. Theſe Myſteries of Chriſt's Kingdom cannot theſe perſonal Reigners ſee; to wit, believe any more than the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>H.

               <p>Theſe things we thought good to lay down in the explaining the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt's Government in his Church, to help the weak that are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Point, by ſuch as ſeek, whether out of ignorance or not, to demean the glory of Chriſt's Reign in his Church or Kingdom, who do as good as ſay, Chriſt hath no <hi>(a)</hi> Kingdom: yet when we are told by <hi>John,</hi> that he was in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9. and the Primitive Chriſtians are ſaid all of them to be <hi>delivered from the Power of Darkneſs,</hi> (to wit, Satan's Kingdom afore proved) <hi>and tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. That as Sin once reigned in them in Satan's Kingdom, now being in Chriſt's Kingdom, <hi>(b)</hi> Grace might reign in them through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt; and thus Chriſt reigns over his Saints in Mount <hi>Sion</hi> for ever and ever. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as Chriſt is God <hi>(c)</hi> equal with the Father, ſo all Civil Magiſtratical Government in Nations is ordained by him; ſo that by him <hi>(d)</hi> Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice: And though Chriſt by demeaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the work of Mans Redemption and Mediation for them, in which work he did take our <hi>(e)</hi> Nature on him, and became a ſervant to his own Ordinance in paying the Magiſtrates Tribute; yet as he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, unto whom all Judgment is commited, all Kings &amp; Princes muſt bow their Scepters to <hi>(f)</hi> him, in believing in him and ſubmitting to him, in obeying his Commands in his Church or Kingdom, in the practice of all his holy Ordinances. And thus are all the Kings and Judges of the Earth to <hi>(g)</hi> ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling, ſo to <hi>kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and they periſh,</hi> bringing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108372:17"/>their glory and honour to preſerve his Church from outward Injuries, as Nurſing-fathers. And thus the Lord in his mercy directs both high and low, rich and poor, to make an end of their ſalvation with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; that ſo every one may fight the good fight of faith, and finiſhing their courſe in keeping the faith ſhall ſurely have the Crown of <hi>(h)</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Glory at the day of his appearing.

               <p>The next Ordinance in order to be performed in the Church of Chriſt is <hi>Baptiſm of Water,</hi> which peculiarly belongeth to the Paſtor or Teacher to perform, and no other. Since extraordinary Offices of Apoſtles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts are ceaſed, therefore, in order for the performance thereof, there muſt be a true Adminiſtrator; for theſe Reaſons: firſt, becauſe the viſible Seals of the Covenant, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> may not be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by any other than the Miniſters of the Word, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. ſaying, <hi>Go, teach all Nations, and baptize, &amp;c.</hi> In which place our Lord commandeth Apoſtolick Authority unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, for teaching the Covenant of the Goſpel contained in the Prophets, and ſealing the ſame to all thoſe the Promiſe did belong unto, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. and hath no-where admitted any to baptize, whom he ſent not in Office to <hi>(a)</hi> preach theſe things: therefore <hi>what God hath joyned together, let no man put aſunder.</hi> The applying of the Seals is a greater work than the preaching of the Word, inaſmuch as it aſſureth and confirmeth the ſame unto the Faithful; as the very name of a Seal, and uſe of Sealing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. &amp; 4.30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>John</hi> 6.27. As in earthly Affairs it skilleth not what hand writ the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Covenant, but heed is to be taken that the Seal is fixt by him that hath authority to confirm the ſame; how much more abundantly in this weighty work ſhould this care and heed be taken in Sealing of our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, wherein is contained all the Promiſes of God in Chriſt to us of our eternal Inheritance, which is confirmed to us by the adminiſtration of Sacramental Signs. Moreover there is the like for Baptiſm as were the figures in the Law; for it is written of the <hi>Levites</hi> and Prieſts of the Tribe of <hi>Levi, they ſhall teach</hi> Jacob <hi>thy Judgments, and Iſrael thy Law, they ſhall put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe before thy Face, and burnt-Offerings upon thy Altar continually;</hi> which are noted to be particular works of the Prieſts that came of <hi>Levi,</hi> and is joyn'd to them with their teaching the Law; yet it was lawful in <hi>Iſrael</hi> for any that could, of what Tribe ſoever, to preach, propheſy, or expound the Scriptures: but when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> would have burnt Incenſe on the Altar, it was told him, that it appertained not to him, but to the Prieſts that were conſecrated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.16, 17. And as the Word might be preached by any in the Church, yea and things figured by Incenſe, to wit Prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.10. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108372:18"/>by all; but the Figures themſelves adminiſtred by none, ſave ſuch as God hath thereunto conſecrated; even ſo now the Word may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed or preached by Men out of office in the Church as aforeſaid, but the Sign or Seal which ſeals the ſame, may be adminiſtred only by them whom Chriſt hath called to the Work of his Miniſtry, even Paſtors and Teachers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>Again, the Compariſon made by the Apoſtle of the honour of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood, not taken of any but the called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> And the calling of Chriſt to the Office of his Prieſthood, may teach us the like: for Chriſt's Miniſtry is more honourable than that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> therefore the inſealing Ordinances of Water-Baptiſm and the Lords Supper belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Men in Office, to wit Paſtor or Teacher, Miniſters under Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, 11. as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>John</hi> for his Office and Work ſurnamed the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> was called and ſent of God for the performance of his Miniſtry before Chriſt came; and that not for preaching only, but in ſpecial and by name for Baptizing, as it is written, <hi>He ſent me to baptize;</hi> therefore called the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> which Title belongeth to no Chriſtian ſince, no not to the Apoſtles, though they did baptize. Therefore in the firſt Inſtitution of the Seal of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Lord commended the ſame to his peculiar ſent Meſſenger to; teach us that none may adminiſter them but thoſe that are called and ſent to that end. And this the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged, both in reſorting to <hi>John</hi> for the Seal, which they needed not if any other might have given the ſame; and alſo by the Queſtion which ſome demanded of him, <hi>Why baptizeſt thou, if thou be not the Chriſt, nor Elias, nor tha Prophet?</hi> By which it appears that they held it unlawful for any to baptize but a Prophet of God. Except therefore that we ſhould hold the Baptiſm of Chriſt to be inferior to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>John,</hi> we muſt look that ſuch as baptize be ſent and authorized by him. And not as thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that title which no Chriſtian in the Apoſtles days durſt; but 'tis like they do it to cover their diſorderly allowance and practice they uſe, that many among them that can preach, may baptize, though not in office of Paſtor or Teacher. Let ſuch beware of the preſumption of <hi>Corah,</hi> (<hi>Numb.</hi> 16.15, 30, 31. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) in preſuming above what is written, be not laid to their charge, in running upon the Adminiſtration of Chriſt's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance before they were ſent; as after is noted, how <hi>John Smith</hi> did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize himſelf by dipping: and from him they that call themſelves <hi>Baptists,</hi> received Baptiſm by ſucceſſion: a woful and ſinful pattern.</p>
               <p>Again; <hi>Paul,</hi> though he had this work included in his Apoſtleſhip, or extraordinary Office; yet it may be thought, becauſe it was not expreſly mentioned at his Calling, he thought himſelf not ſo much bound to baptize as to preach the Goſpel; for that Chriſt had not ſent him to do it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108372:18"/>1.17. Now if Baptizing be not a work for which ſome are call'd and ſent, but that all may do it out of office; to what purpoſe doth the Apoſtle urge this, that Chriſt had not ſent him to baptize?</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Sects in <hi>Corinth</hi> give light in this point: for ſome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſome <hi>Cophas;</hi> taking occaſion as it ſeems by the perſons that baptized them, unto whom they leaned more than unto others; for which cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was glad becauſe he had baptized ſo few of them, leſt any ſhould ſay he baptized in his own name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11, 14, 16.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament were adminiſtred by Men call'd of God thereto: As the Ark was a figure of Baptiſm, built by <hi>Noah,</hi> a Prieſt and Preacher of <hi>(a)</hi> Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. Circumciſion adminiſtred by <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Prophet and Patriarch and Prieſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. The private Paſſover by the Elders and Fathers of Families, the publick Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in the place which the Lord did chuſe, and that by the Miniſtry of Prieſts and Levites. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> unto <hi>Moſes</hi> the Man of God were baptized, and fed with ſpiritual meat and drink; and to this day the Jewiſh Prieſts circumciſe all their Children in their Synagogues in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places. So Chriſt the Maſter did eat the Paſſeover with his Diſciples, he it was that took the Bread, bleſſed and brake it, and gave it to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at his laſt Supper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. Theſe things <hi>Paul</hi> urged to be minded in the Church: for to what purpoſe are Officers choſen in the Old and New Teſtament, but that a ſpecial Work belongeth to them, which every one are not to take of themſelves to do, but he that is called of God; leſt they be guilty of as great a Judgment of Leproſy, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi>'s Body, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16, 21. in their ſoul's procuring God's Wrath under a good pretence, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.10, 11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.15. ſealing God's Judgment, and not his Favour unto them. If it be objected by any that Baptiſm was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by <hi>Philip,</hi> a Deacon; <hi>Ananias,</hi> a Diſcipſe; by the Men of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and the like. We anſwer, That <hi>Philip</hi> baptized when he was a Deacon, cannot be proved; the contrary appeareth by the Deacon's Office, which was to ſerve Tables, <hi>Acts.</hi> 6.2. but <hi>Philip</hi> when he baptized was a Miniſter of the Word, and named expreſly an Evangeliſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.8. which was one of thoſe extraordinary Officers, given for a time for the work of the Miniſtry: this Office he had when he baptized. Moreover, he was authorized expreſly, and furniſhed with gifts of working Miracles, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. That <hi>Ananias</hi> was a private Man, as ſome ſuppoſe, cannot be proved: for he was by the Lord call'd and ſent, and enabled to work Miracles, as <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo a Diſciple, when he was choſen and taken of <hi>Paul</hi> to aſſiſt him, is not to be accounted a private man, but an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. ſent and authorized by the Lord. Moreover, if it were granted that he was a private man, yet his action done by expreſs command from God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108372:19"/>might not be followed by other private men, any more than the action of <hi>Gideon</hi> in offering Sacrifice, which belonged only to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> might be followed by others of his Brethren of the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſes, Judg.</hi> 6.15, 25, 26. That any private Man of <hi>Cyprus</hi> or <hi>Cyrene</hi> adminiſtred Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm or the Lords Supper, cannot be proved. As for <hi>Apollos,</hi> he cannot be accounted a private Man whom <hi>Paul</hi> joyned with himſelf; nor <hi>Cephas,</hi> a Planter and Miniſter, whom the <hi>Corinthians</hi> followed as one of their chief Teachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. &amp; 2.6. &amp; 4.6.</p>
               <p>To conclude the end of all; As it appeareth by the Scriptures, that God hath in all Ages permitted the Diſpenſation of the Sacraments, or viſible Seals of God's Covenant, to the Miniſters of the Word, choſen and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for that purpoſe; and not to all or any other. They therefore that ſhall teach or preach, or practiſe any otherwiſe, ſhall walk in the ſin of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who ſinned, and made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin; in whoſe days whoſoever would conſecrate himſelf might execute the Prieſts Office in the high places: which thing turned to ſin, to root out <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Houſe from the face of the Earth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.33, 34. Theſe things being written for all Chriſtians learning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. that none may preſume out of a good intent (as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> did) to break God's Order, leſt God's Wrath break out againſt them in this life (as it did upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza),</hi> they may hear the Sentence of Chriſt, (notwithſtanding their preaching, and boaſting what Works they have done in his Name,) ſaying unto them, <hi>I never knew you, Depart from me ye workers of Iniquity. Iſa.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch then as in theſe latter days we are taught by Chriſt, that there ſhall be many, ſaying, Loe here, and loe there is Chriſt; but he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us not to go after them, becauſe they follow not the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> in his holy Order, in the practice of his holy Ordinances. Therefore for our better underſtanding, in order to the performance of this Ordinance in the Church, to wit, Water-Baptiſm, we may obſerve three things. (1.) The End, wherefore it was ordained. (2.) What gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth perſons right unto it. (3.) The Manner, how it ought to be performed.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt. Baptiſm of Water was ordained of God, to manifeſt Chriſt to <hi>Iſrael, John</hi> 1.31. And alſo it was a Sign of the Remiſſion of Sins by the Blood of Chriſt to all thoſe the Promiſes in the Goſpel belong unto. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which giveth any right to partake of the Sign or viſible Seal of the Covenant of the Goſpel, is not by any Act of Man, but by the free Grace and Love of God in Chriſt, without any deſert of ours, to all thoſe he pleaſed to accept into the Covenant of the Goſpel; to all ſuch it is written, that he <hi>will be merciful unto their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and iniquities will he remember no more, Heb.</hi> 8.12. Therefore as the Lord did
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108372:19"/>ever accept into his Covenant the Fathers with their Children, ſo have both equally the Promiſes belonging to them of the Pardon of their ſins; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have they by virtue of the Covenant, a right to the Sign or viſible Seal of the pardon of their ſins, even Baptiſm of Water; and hereupon as the believing Parents with their Infants were accepted into God's Covenant, therefore did the Apoſtles baptize Believers with their houſhold, which were their Children, as anon ſhall be proved. Moreover, there is no Act of Man that can give him right to any Ordinance of God, but only God's Mercy in Chriſt manifeſted in the Covenant of the Goſpel from the days of <hi>Adam:</hi> But if it be the pleaſure of God, as it was in all Ages, to accept the Children with the Parents into the Covenant of Grace; and therefore the Benefit of the Covenant ever belonged to them, to wit, the Seal of Faith with them, and never forbidden the ſame, only the outward Sign or Seal changed from Circumciſion to Water-Baptiſm; How dare any Man then deny the Infants of the Covenant, the Sign of the Remiſſion of their Sins? which right they enjoy by the Covenant, ſeeing they were with their Parents of old, <hi>(a)</hi> holy, even ſo they are <hi>(b)</hi> now a choſen Generation, and holy Nation, with them: ſo <hi>(c)</hi> now <hi>(d)</hi> Olive Plants, Buds, or young <hi>(e)</hi> Branches in the Vice <hi>CHRIST.</hi> So are Believers the Bleſſed of the Lord, and their <hi>(f)</hi> Off-ſpring or Buds with them the Lord's <hi>(g)</hi> Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and of the Kingdom of God; &amp; though veſſels of ſmall <hi>(h)</hi> quantity, yet with their Parents are they a part of the Glory of Chriſt's Houſe or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; having faith in the bud, elſe could they not <hi>(i)</hi> hope in God on their Mothers breaſts, which in due time was made manifeſt in their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, crying in the Temple <hi>(k) Hoſanna to the Son of David</hi> (that is, <hi>O Lord ſave)</hi> to the amazement of the carnal Profeſſors then, and alſo now; who are offended at them, ſo as they account the Children of Believers in the ſame eſtate with the Children of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans:</hi> contrary to the Scriptures that ever accounted the Children of the Church of God holy, ſanctified from the Womb; when as the Children of Unbelievers are unclean, eſtranged from the Womb, accounted <hi>(l)</hi> Liars from the birth, Children of <hi>(m)</hi> Wrath, in one eſtate with the World of <hi>(n)</hi> ungodly, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Flood, and their Spirits with their Parents are ſaid to be in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as the Children of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> being accounted <hi>(o)</hi> unrighteous with their Parents, ſuffered likewiſe with them the vengeance of eternal Fire. But the Children of the Members of the Church of God, Chriſt <hi>(p)</hi> bleſſed with his ſpiritual bleſſing, towit, the <hi>(q)</hi> Remiſſion of their Sins, as all in God's Covenant have the equal and alike benefit of, being born in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are ſaid to be the Lords Children, <hi>(r)</hi> baptized by one Spirit with their Parents in to Chriſt's Myſtical Body; ſo have they his Spirit, elſe could they not be <hi>(ſ)</hi> Chriſt's, or holy with their Parents a holy Nation. So
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108372:20"/>that we may conclude with the Apoſtle, ſeeing theſe have received the <hi>(t)</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as well as we, who ſhall <hi>forbid water, that they ſhould not be baptized?</hi> (a) <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.2.

               <p>Therefore upon theſe Grounds did the Apoſtle baptize Believers and their Houſe or Houſholds, ſeeing only the Children in reſpect of God's Covenant are ſo called: The Man muſt take his Brother's Wife to build his Brother's Houſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.5, 6, 9. <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi> built the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to wit, by Children, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.11. The Widow of <hi>Zareptha</hi>'s Son was called her Houſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.12, 13, 14, 15. A Biſhop or Paſtor muſt rule his own Houſe well, having his Children in ſubjection, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Jacob</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> every Man and his Houſhold, that is, they and their Children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ſaid to nouriſh his Father and all his Father's Houſhold, as is expounded, <hi>I will nouriſh you and your Children, Gen.</hi> 45.11. and 46.5, 6, 7, 8. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.21. <hi>David dwelt at Gath, he and his Men, every Man with his Houſhold,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.3. which by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. was their Sons and Daughters. And to the barren Woman when promiſed Seed, ſhe is ſaid to dwell in a Houſe, that is, to be a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mother of Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.9. So that they muſt be wilfully blind, that ſhall deny the Apoſtle to have baptized Children, ſeeing the Houſhold are the Children, and they did baptize the Believers and their Houſhold, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the Goſpel which the Apoſtle <hi>Matthew</hi> taught, beginneth with <hi>(a) Ahraham</hi> according to the <hi>(b)</hi> Covenant of Grace made with him, that in <hi>his Seed</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>ſhall all Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> to wit, the <hi>(c)</hi> Families or Kindreds, the Believer and his Children; in which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God promiſed to be a <hi>(d)</hi> God to them and their Seed: So that as <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> in Infancy was a Child of Promiſe, as ſaith the Apoſtle to the Church, which conſiſts of Men, Women, and <hi>(e)</hi> Children; ſo are we Children of the Promiſe. To which alſo agreeth the Doctrine of <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>The</hi> (f) <hi>Promiſe is to you and your</hi> (g) <hi>Children.</hi> And thus the Children of the Church under the Goſpel are as <hi>(h)</hi> aforetime, further confirmed by Chriſt to <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> who ſaid unto him, becauſe he believed, <hi>This day is Salvation come to thy</hi> (i) <hi>Houſe,</hi> foraſmuch as he was the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though ſuppoſed by nature a <hi>Gentile.</hi> Thus Chriſt taught the Goſpel afore preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he believing it, was a Son of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo his Houſe, which was afore proved to be the Children, had Salvation imputed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108372:20"/>equally to them as to their Parents; and therefore as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was accepted into the Lord's Covenant, ſo was his Children, who have their ſins waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away in the Blood of Chriſt in the everlaſting <hi>(k)</hi> Covenant, Baptiſm being a viſible Sign or Seal thereof. Therefore have they both Father and Children right unto the ſame, elſe the Apoſtle would not have baptized them and their <hi>(l)</hi> Houſholds. Therefore it is a groſs Miſtake in them that deny the Infants of Believers Water-Baptiſm; and alſo account the Infants of Believers and Unbelievers in a like eſtate, nay their Doctrine ſubverts the whole Order of the Goſpel in reſpect of the Promiſes of Life &amp; Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt; and in a word, it is another <hi>(m)</hi> Goſpel than ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught; that the Lord ſhould accept the believing Father into his Covenant, and leave his Children in an equal ſtate with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſo that ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Though we or an Angel from Heaven preach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel unto you than that which we have preached, let him be accurſed.</hi> And again, when any Proſelyte <hi>Gentile</hi> of old did joyn himſelf (by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed) to the Lord and his Church, the Lord did require of him profeſſion of his Faith, becauſe he had been an actual Tranſgreſſor as aforeſaid; yet he only was not received into the Church by the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo his Infants. And though the Father was circumciſed, yet might he not partake of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over till all his Males were <hi>(n)</hi> circumciſed, becauſe they were accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>(o)</hi> Covenant; and as the Females wanted that part of the Body, and ſo could not be actually circumciſed, yet being in Covenant as well as the Males, were accounted as circumciſed, elſe they might not enter into the <hi>(p)</hi> Temple. And again, as the Lord's Supper came in place of the <hi>(q)</hi> Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and Water-Baptiſm in the place of <hi>(r)</hi> Circumciſion, being the Seals of one and the ſame Covenant, and the Subjects being by the Lord never rejected or removed; it doth neceſſarily follow, that when the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of old, he muſt not eat the Paſſeover till all his Males were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <hi>(ſ),</hi> that is, had the Seal of <hi>(t)</hi> Faith ſet on them; even ſo by like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing the Covenant is the ſame, though the Father is baptized, yet he muſt not eat of the Lords Supper till all his Infants are baptized; which was one reaſon why the Apoſtles did not only baptize Believers, but alſo their Children or <hi>(u)</hi> Houſhold. And thus the Faith of the Saints is built upon the Doctrine or Foundation of the Apoſtles and <hi>(w)</hi> Prophets, and all other is but Fancy inſtead of Faith, and ſo deceive themſelves, and them that are led by them, to the deſtruction of their poor Souls.

               <p>Therefore in order to the opening of the true meaning of the Word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> we ſhall obſerve in the Scriptures there are three ſeveral Baptiſms; One of the Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. One of Suffering, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.38. The third of Water, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. All which Baptiſms bear one and the ſame ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe by one and the ſame Word they are all declared unto us; ſo that what ſence or ſignification is to be underſtood in the adminiſtration of the Spiritual Baptiſm, the ſame is to be underſtood in the adminiſtration of the Water-Baptiſm, and likewiſe in the Baptiſm of Suffering. And ſo we ſhall by God's own way, in comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, come to diſcern the Truth of God's Mind in the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Manner of the Adminiſtration of Spiritual-Baptiſm by the Lord himſelf, is ſaid by the Spirit of God, to be by pouring his Spirit on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not by dipping; as it is written in the Promiſe, and after fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17, 18. &amp; 10.45. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.29. After the manner of rain or ſprinkling, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. Now ſome have the Spirit poured on them in a greater meaſure than others; ſome were in the Church Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, ſome Teachers, and all differing in the meaſure of the Spirit received, yet all were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of the Spirit, yea the whole Church were by one Spirit baptized into one Body; though ſome but Babes in Chriſt, yet all had the Baptiſm of the Spirit. Now therefore who dare preſume to limit the Spiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to ſay none were baptized with the Spirit, but them that had the greateſt meaſure?</p>
               <p>After this manner in reſpect of meaſure are we to underſtand the Baptiſm of Suffering, one ſuffering more, another leſs; as for example, ſome ſuffer reproaches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13. others ſuffer reproaches and loſs of goods; others ſuffer reproaches, loſs of goods, and liberty, <hi>Eſay</hi> 51.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9. &amp; 2.10. Others ſuffer all the aforeſaid, and loſs of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.2. Then who dare preſume to ſay, that they that did not ſuffer in the greateſt meaſure, as loſs of Life, did not partake of the Baptiſm of Suffering?</p>
               <p>Now then Water-Baptiſm being one and the ſame Word in ſignification, muſt be underſtood to agree with the former Baptiſm, eſpecially of the Spiritual Baptiſm, after which manner the Lord himſelf baptized the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea. When the Clouds poured forth water upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.17. yet they went through the Sea on dry foot. The manner of which Baptiſm the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the Church of God ignorant of, ſaying, <hi>All our Fathers were baptized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Moſes, in the Cloud, and in the Sea,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.2. Surely the manner of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> on the Eunuch, was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108372:21"/>after this manner, in caſting water after the manner of Rain or Sprinkling, on them; for <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not deprived of any ſenſe when they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Sea, as of ſeeing, hearing and breathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God's Creation, as theſe in our days that are baptized by dipping. Neither were they in the Sea nor in <hi>Jordan,</hi> as we read of, ſtript of their Apparel to one thin Covering; which is not modeſt, ſeemly, nor of a good report, for a Woman to appear before any Man, beſides her Husband, in ſuch a dreſs, under the pretence they cannot be baptized with their Garments on: ſurely if one may cover that part of the Body, that he believes muſt be baptized, with one Covering, he may with more; for without doubt that part of the Body that is to be baptized ought to have no Covering on it; for if it hath a Covering, they baptize the Covering, and not the Fleſh. For as the Face repreſenteth the whole Perſon; as <hi>Hagar</hi> fled from the Face of <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 16.6, 8. that was from her Perſon; and <hi>Moſes</hi> fled from the Face of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was the like: So likewiſe the ſorrow of Man's labour, which Sin brought, is ſignified by the ſweat of the <hi>Face, Gen.</hi> 3. Likewiſe when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſet his <hi>Face</hi> to go to Mount <hi>Gilead</hi> from <hi>Laban,</hi> it repreſented his Affection and Actions with deſire. So when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſent a Preſent to <hi>Eſau,</hi> it was to appeaſe him, that is, his Face, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.20. So when <hi>Lot</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Zoar, Gen.</hi> 19.21. God is ſaid to accept <hi>his Face</hi> in granting his requeſt. So then the Face that repreſenteth the Perſon, which being bare in the Red Sea, was that part of the Body that was baptized, waſhed, or ſprinkled.</p>
               <p>And thus the Word in Water Baptiſm agreeth with the Spiritual, by pouring forth or ſprinkling; and as the former Seal of the ſame everlaſting Covenant of the Goſpel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. was ſet on that Part of the Body, the Inſtrument of Generation, to teach them Regeneration of Nature, even of the whole Man born in Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. And that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of the Covenant might be to the Seed of the Faithful, who are thereby holy, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.2. And though the Lips and Ears are ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in ſome reſpects. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.10. yet the whole Body is ſaid to be circumciſed, as being done on a part ſignifying the whole: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo in Baptiſm, Water is caſt upon the Face, as a Sign or Signal of Death, or that we were worthy to die; as when the Servants of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus</hi> underſtood by the King's words, that Death was determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Haman,</hi> they <hi>(a)</hi> covered his Face, as a Signal of Death. Even ſo by reaſon of Sin, we come ſhort of the <hi>(b)</hi> glory of God, and our Faces are vailed or covered under the <hi>(c)</hi> condemnation of the Law, until Chriſt by his Baptiſm fulfilled the Righteouſneſs of the Law for us: In ſign whereof have we water caſt upon our faces, as a ſign that we were not only worthy to die, and ſo <hi>(e)</hi> baptized for the dead, but that Chriſt by his Death hath <hi>(f)</hi> waſhed us from our ſins in his Blood; ſo that by his <hi>(g)</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to us, we with unvailed, or <hi>(h)</hi> open faces behold the Glory
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108372:22"/>of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory by the Spirit of the Lord. (a) <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.8. (b) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. (c) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8. (d) <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. (e) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. (f) <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. (g) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. (h) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Satan hath yet uſed in theſe laſt and perilous days, wherein Deceivers grow worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived, another ſlight to peryert the Goſpel of Chriſt, in contending about words to no profit, ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, to limit or confine the ſignification of the word <hi>[baptize]</hi> to one ſignification in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue, only to dip the whole body in water, and account all other ſenſes unlawful; contrary to all the Learned that have tranſlated the Scriptures into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or wrote <hi>Dictionaries;</hi> and alſo contrary to the Analogy of Faith in the Scriptures: Therefore the Learned in tranſlating the holy Scriptures durſt not limit many words, but rendred them in ſuch terms, as the Godly may by the help of the Spirit of God, rightly divide the true ſenſe and meaning of the ſame: As for example; the Greek word <hi>[Eccleſia]</hi> for Church, ſignifying few, or many, is rendred <hi>Congregation,</hi> or gathering together by holy Covenant in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> to become the Lord's People: who are ſometimes a little flock, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. even but two or three, <hi>Mut.</hi> 18.20. ſometimes three thouſand and more, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. Yet both few and many are a Church, comprehended in the word <hi>Eccleſia;</hi> and ſo in the Hebrew word <hi>Kahal</hi> for Church. Likewiſe the Greek word for Worſhip <hi>Latria,</hi> and <hi>Latrevo,</hi> ſometimes taken largely, when in Worſhip all God's (*) Ordinances are perſormed; and ſometimes ſtrictly, when only (†) to bow down and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate unto God is Worſhip. Again, the word <hi>Saviour</hi> ſometimes ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11. Sometimes he makes thoſe Miniſters as Inſtruments to ſave perſons by his Doctrine, <hi>Obad. v.</hi> 21. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. So likewiſe the word <hi>Elohim</hi> ſometimes is uſed to ſignify Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7. ſometimes it ſignifies Magiſtrates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1. and many the like. Even ſo the word <hi>Baptiſma, or baptizo,</hi> is rendred by Scholars in Dictionaries, to dive over head, to waſh, to water, to ſprinkle, to baptize: ſee <hi>Gould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Dictionary. So that he that ſhall confine the word <hi>[haptizo]</hi> to one ſenſe, may by the ſame, reaſon limit all the former words to one ſenſe, and ſo make a confuſion in every ones underſtanding of the uſe of holy Scriptures, as they do that confine the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> to Dipping, when all Churches, according to the Wiſdom of God, are left free what quantity of water they may uſe in Baptiſm. For though the Eunuch went into the water, which was no part of his Baptiſm, but what water <hi>Philip</hi> uſes on him was his Baptiſm, but how much we know not. And ſo of <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Now with what preſumption do theſe men, which call themſelves <hi>Bappists,</hi> limit God's Word, and ſo preſume above what is written, to ſay he dipped all the Body? And might not others do ſo by many other words
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108372:22"/>in Scripture, confine how many perſons in number make a Church, or the like, when it is evident <hi>Philip</hi> did not baptiſe all the Body; for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch put ſome part of his Body in the water himſelf, ſo <hi>Philip</hi> could but waſh the reſt. So that it's ſafe when we ſo underſtand the Scriptures, that they agree in one harmony together. (*) <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.6, 7. (†) <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the Place where all Paſtors are bound to adminiſter the viſible Seals of God's Covenant. Baptiſm is not now at Rivers or Ponds, as did the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, whoſe Offices were extraordinary, and not limited to any particular Congregation, becauſe they received not their Office ordinarily from the Church, but were immedialy called by Chriſt, and ſo not of Men, not of <hi>(a)</hi> Man, and therefore it is written to Paſtors and Teachers, choſen by the Church they are Members of, to feed the Flock of God, <hi>over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them</hi> (b) <hi>Over ſeers;</hi> ſo that <hi>Archippus</hi> is bid to <hi>take heed to his Miniſtry, which he had received in the Lord, that he</hi> (c) <hi>fulfil it.</hi> Moreover, as all ordinary Civil Offices in a Kingdom or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth are limited within their Corporated Cities and Charters, and have no power to execute any part of their Office out of the Limits ſet them: Even ſo are the ordinary Offices of Chriſt's Church; as of Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons, choſen by their corporated and particular Bodies, and commanded (as by <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.28. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17.) there to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil their Miniſterial Office; and not as ſome in the Apoſtles days, who ſaid they were Apoſtles, to go from one Congregation to another when they pleaſe, and baptize at any place; but when the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who knew that the full Number of the Apoſtles names was already recorded in the foundation of the <hi>(d)</hi> Walls of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> tried them to prove their Call, and found them * Liars, falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, transforming themſelves into the <hi>(e)</hi> Apoſtles of Chriſt. And we may believe that there are many in theſe days, that by like trial will be found falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who Apoſtle-like baptize out of the ſtative corporative Body of the Church gathered together, and without the knowledge of the Church; and ſo not with <hi>Archippus</hi> fulfill their Miniſtry within the Limits of their Charters. Again, as there are ſome authorized under Civil Kings, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who are ſent to other Nations to treat with them of Peace, or like State-Matters; others they employ as Meſſengers, and they are ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Maſters Buſineſs in any part of their Dominions; others are Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in Towns, Cities, or Burroughs, limited within the Bounds of their Charter: Even ſo the Lord Jeſus, King of Kings, ſent his Apoſtles Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors <hi>(f)</hi> to other Nations, to treat of Peace by the preaching of his Goſpel; others were ſent as Evangeliſts, or <hi>(g)</hi> Meſſengers, from one Church to another, ſo far as the Churches were gathered; others were ordinary Officers, as Paſtors, Teachers, Elders and Deacons, and they were not to go without the <hi>(h)</hi> Limits of the Congregation that had choſen
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108372:23"/>them, to adminiſter either Baptiſm with water, or the Lord's Supper. (a) <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. (b) <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. (c) <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. (d) <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14.

               <p>Yet we read of one <hi>John Smith,</hi> firſt a Miniſter in <hi>England,</hi> after joyned himſelf a Member of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where <hi>Henry Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> was Teacher, and for ſin was caſt out of that Church; ſoon after Satan drew him to deny the Covenant preached to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which led him to deny his Baptiſm received in Infancy. And though there were many more then of his Judgment, yet they knew not where to have an Adminiſtrator to begin Baptiſm by dipping; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Satan had begun to inſtruct him, he added Sin unto Sin, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized himſelf; then he baptized one Mr. <hi>Helviſh,</hi> and <hi>John Morton,</hi> with the reſt. And this is teſtified by one Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> who (as he ſaith) was one of them, and after by grace renounced their evil doings, and wrote a Book againſt them, entituled, a Diſcovery of the Errors of that People in the Year 1623, pag. 65. Likewiſe <hi>H. Ainſworth</hi> ſaith, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> baptized himſelf, in his Book called, a <hi>Defence of Holy Scripture,</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Smith,</hi> pag. 69, 82. So ſaith Mr. <hi>Clifton</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Plea</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> pag. 185, 224. Now let the wiſe judg, in what abominable diſorder they retain their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ever ſince from Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and whether it ſtinketh not in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of the Lord ever ſince, as the Miniſtry of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company?</p>
               <p>Moreover, as Water-Baptiſm came in <hi>(a)</hi> place of Circumciſion; and when <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell into Apoſtacy, yet they in that eſtate did circumciſe: and when they returned by repentance unto the Lord, and renewed their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Lord did not require them to <hi>reiterate,</hi> or <hi>(b)</hi> circumciſe them again that were circumciſed in Apoſtacy, though they might have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the foreskin again by Surgery, as the Apoſtle <hi>(c)</hi> obſerveth; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Joſeph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and alſo Hiſtory declares.</p>
               <p>Having afore ſhewed how in this <hi>Land</hi> a <hi>Goſpel-Church</hi> was planted, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell into Apoſtacy, yet they ſtill baptized their Children as the Apoſtles did the Houſholds afore-proved to be <hi>Children.</hi> So that when we that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in Apoſtacy, are returned by the Call of God to the Lord by unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Repentance, we are not to rebaptize again thoſe that were baptized in Apoſtacy, ſeeing the Covenant is the ſame that Circumciſion was a Seal of, as now Water-Baptiſm is. And thus we have a ground in God's Word for our practice, which they have not that receive their Baptiſm from <hi>John Smith,</hi> that baptized himſelf, as afore proved. And thus when all God's Ordinances are ended, the whole is concluded by Prayer. (a) <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. (b) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.21, 22. (c) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.18.</p>
               <p>And again; As this Spouſe of Chriſt is his Body, compact together by the ſupply of every joynt: ſo the Eyes are call'd Seers, or Teachers, when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108372:23"/>they by heavenly Doctrine ſee good for the Body, are inſtead of Eyes; and when they adminiſter the Seals, Baptiſm and the Supper, with the Cenſures, they are Hands to the Church; and when they reprove Sin, they are the Mouth; and when they are employed in the Churches Meſſage, they are the Feet of the Church; and when they themſelves have done amiſs, and are reproved by the Church, they are the Ears of the Church, to hear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; and ſo proportionably are all the Members in their places, keeping order every one within the Limits of their Places, ſet by God in the Body, his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>And again, as the Church in her beginning is ſaid to be a Siſter that hath no breaſts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. that is, Miniſters, as Paſtor and Teacher; Which Breaſts do naturally ariſe out of the Body, when God's Gifts and Graces are increaſed, and ſome found fit to be called or elected and ordained into Office by the Church, then are her Breaſts ſaid to be faſhioned, as was of old in <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 16.7. and in the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And ſo are the new born Children of God ſaid to ſuck the Breaſts of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. Thus out of every true Church or Body of Chriſt, ariſeth Chriſt's true Miniſtry. But what a contrary thing in Nature is it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Body groweth out of the Breaſt; or, in plainneſs of ſpeech, for a Miniſter to be made, and not by a true Church, as one Miniſter (as they call them) to make another, or that a Miniſter maketh the Church, or that a People cannot be a true Church before they have a Miniſter. This unnatural belief is for want of better learning in the School of Chriſt; which leads Men to retain the Ordination of their Miniſters ſucceſſively from <hi>Rome,</hi> left in this Land when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died, who then were Miniſters in the Popiſh Orders, and when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, they that would conform to the things then impoſed on them, did ſtill adminiſter without any other Ordination; and ſo from that Root ever ſince doth one Miniſter make another. He that is wiſe may conſider this, and know, that they that retain any other Miniſtry or Worſhip which Chriſt hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Teſtament, he will tell them, for all their preaching, <hi>he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew them.</hi>

               <p>Next followeth the Ordinance of the Lords Super to be performed, as a <hi>(a)</hi> Remembrance of Chriſt's Death, and the Communion all that partake thereof have with Chriſt as his <hi>(b)</hi> Members, and the Communion they have one with another in Chriſt as one anothers Members; ſo that all of years, able to examine themſelves, ought to partake thereof, and no others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a paſſive Ordinance (as Water-Baptiſm) to be adminiſtred upon; but it is written, <hi>Take and eat.</hi> And thus when this Ordinance is performed, the Church, according to the Example of Chriſt, do ſing a <hi>(e)</hi> Pſalm, concluding all with Prayer. So that as we do believe that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108372:24"/>God is a God of <hi>(d)</hi> Order, and hath recorded his great diſpleaſure when in his Worſhip <hi>(e)</hi> Order was not kept. Therefore we have (as we do believe and practiſe) laid down the holy Order the Primitive Churches performed Chriſt's Ordinances in, and we are to follow the good old Way, in the <hi>(f)</hi> Footſteps of the Lord's Flock. Therefore as the Ordinance of Singing was uſed, after ſanctified by the Word, Chriſt, and Prayer in him to the Father, as an Ordinance of Joy when the Church entred into the Lord's <hi>(g)</hi> Court in his ſervice; ſo do we believe the Primitive Churches practiſed. 2dly, As <hi>(h)</hi> Reading was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> performed before Doctrine; ſo doth the Apoſtle exhort <hi>Timothy,</hi> that in the Church it be ſo <hi>(i)</hi> performed. Next after the Word is read and expounded, and likewiſe the Word taught by Doctrine, by Office followeth the Ordinance of <hi>(k)</hi> Prophtey; the Youth or young Men by good Order are to give place to the Elders, as in another caſe <hi>(l) Elihu</hi> did. Then in Order followeth the Ordinance of Government, that as all are to judg of what was taught, either by Office or membral Right in the Church; ſo that if Error hath by any been taught, and after the firſt and ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition <hi>(m)</hi> they remain impenitent, in this time of Government before the Throne of Chriſt, on them may be executed the Judgment written; that a little leaven do not leaven the whole lump: ſo likewiſe on any Member for other Sins, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. And alſo in this time of Government, if any Perſon were converted before by the Word of God taught, the Gates of this heavenly City are <hi>(n)</hi> opened by the authority of Chriſt on his Throne, and they joyned with their ſeed by a willing Covenant with the Lord and his People, which Covenant is the Form of the Church, as it is the Form of Marriage, and without it a People are no Church any more than without a Covenant Man and Woman can become Man and Wife; therefore was the Church ſaid to be <hi>(o)</hi> eſpouſed to Chriſt; <hi>As a young Man marrieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons (p) marry thee.</hi> Next followeth the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that thoſe the Lord received by Covenant to be a <hi>(q)</hi> People to him, muſt have the viſible Sign and Seal of the benefit of the ſame, as a Token of the Remiſſion of their Sins by the Blood of Chriſt, if they never were baptized before: for Baptiſm is not the Form of the Church, neither are any joyned to the Lord nor his Church by it; but it is the Sign of the benefit of the Covenant after we are joyned to the Lord. But if any think Perſons are made Members of Chriſt by Water-Baptiſm, then as often as they may be caſt out of the Church for Sin, if they repent, they muſt be joyned to the Church by Baptiſm again.

            <head>Reaſons gathered out of the holy Scriptures, to prove, that ſince the Death and Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus, not only the Ceremonial Ordinances for Worſhip are aboliſhed, but alſo the chief Time in which they were performed, to wit, the Seventh-Day Sabbath. And alſo to prove, that as the Lord Jeſus hath not only ordained new Goſpel-Ordinances, but alſo a new Time, in which they are to be performed, to wit, the first Day of the Week for the Goſpel Sabbath.</head>
            <p>THat which moveth us to give our Judgment about the time of Goſpel-Worſhip, is; firſt, for the Glory of God; and ſecondly, for the Comfort of the Elect Children of God, who (we fear) are many of them miſled in their underſtandings, by ſome that now keep the ſeventh Day for the time of Goſpel-Worſhip; and alſo by others, who, though they ſay the ſeventh Day is aboliſhed, yet do believe that Chriſt hath appointed no peculiar Day for his Goſpel-Worſhip; and others that ſay every Day is alike to them, and keep no Day conſcionably at all, only meet for fuſhions ſake, when others do, partly by that opportunity to draw People to their way, and alſo for fear if they open their Shops, they ſhould be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We direct our Words to thoſe that ſay, Chriſt under the Goſpel appointed no peculiar day for his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Such ought to know, That as it ſtands not to the Honour of Kings and Princes, and Maſters of Servants, to appoint their Subjects and Servants their Work, and leave the Time to their Diſcretion, when they think good to do the ſame: How much more doth it not ſtand with the Honour of our Lord Jeſus, Prince of the Kings of the Earth, Lord of Lords, and only Lawgiver to his Church or Subjects, having appointed new Ordinances for his Worſhip, that he ſhould leave the Time to their Pleaſure, when they ſhall think good to perform the ſame. And were it ſo as they ſuppoſe, that Chriſt hath appointed no peculiar day for his Worſhip; when as he hath commanded his Church not to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, and promiſed his Preſence to be with them; which if the time is not by his appointment but theirs, is not this to make the Lord to wait on his Subjects pleaſure, and not they on his? when he ſhall meet with them, and not when they ſhould meet with him? which is contrary to the Order of God both in Grace and Nature; even againſt the Honour and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a King over his Subjects, of a Maſter over his Servants; bringing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108372:25"/>a Babel or Confuſion both in Church and State, and an Article of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Faith about the time of God's Worſhip, who ſay they are bound to believe as the Church believes in this and many other things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to know that the living God is a God of Order; but it was not his Way and Order from the very beginning of the Creation, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Man his Work, and leave the Time to his Diſcretion: for <hi>Adam</hi> by Creation was only Lord of the Earth, and all things therein; but by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Eſtate made between the Lord and himſelf he was made Heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Promiſe, confirmed to him by two Sacramental Signs ſet before them, one called the Tree of Life, repreſenting Chriſt, the now Tree of Life in the ſpiritual Garden of his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. the Way, and no other to Heaven from the beginning, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. The other called the Tree of Knowledg, ſignifying the <hi>(a)</hi> Law now in the ſpiritual Garden of God, the Church of Chriſt, by which is the knowledge of Sin; which Tree of Knowledg in the figure was then forbidden <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife to touch or meddle with the fruit thereof, as we are now by the Law, by eating or believing, that by the works or fruits thereof we can be made happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. And thus <hi>Adam</hi> and his VVife <hi>(b)</hi> willingly covenanted with their Creator, to ſerve and obey the Pleaſure of his VVill; but the Lord left not the Time to their <hi>(c)</hi> diſcretion, but after he had ordered them ſix days for their bodily Exerciſe in <hi>(d)</hi> dreſſing of the Garden and ſuch like civil Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, did alſo appoint them a Sabbath of holy Reſt in his Service, to imploy their Minds in the Meditation of God's Love to them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Sacramental Signs aforeſaid, and likewiſe to praiſe the Lord for all his Mercies in all the VVorks of his Creation, made for their <hi>(e)</hi> ſakes, and alſo to teach them, that by the Time of God's Service inſtituted by the Lord for them, that it was a Sign to them the Lord had ſanctified them.

After Man's Fall, <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt VVriter of holy Scripture, ending his firſt Book, called <hi>Geneſis,</hi> or Generations, with <hi>Iſrael</hi> going into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a Figure of Man's Captivity by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Generations in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. beginneth his next Book, called <hi>Exodus,</hi> or Departure, upon <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s being called to depart out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by the Covenant of Grace after they were come out made with them in Chriſt, they became the Lords People, a holy Nation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. Unto whom the Lord after gave his Law with Ordinances for his VVorſhip; But here we are to note, he did not leave the Time to their Diſcretion when they thought good to do the ſame, but appointed them the Seventh-day Sabbath, afore given to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by the Lord, and to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and hereupon the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was faithful in the Houſe of God as a Servant, who being a Figure of Chriſt in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108372:25"/>Prieſtly and Kingly Offices, appointing both the Ordinances for Worſhip, and alſo the Time. And as Chriſt, who is ſaid to be like unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> yea, more than a Servant, to wit, a Son, and faithful in his own Houſe; inaſmuch as he hath not only appointed new Ordinances for his Worſhip, but alſo a new Time; and ſo in nothing was he inferiour to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as thoſe people would make him, that ſay he hath appointed no particular Day for his Worſhip under the Goſpel. But Chriſt's Diſciples were better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the mind of the Lord, and knew that the day of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was the Goſpel Sabbath: Therefore on the firſt Day did they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together to Prayer and Religious Duties, <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf appearing among them after he was riſen, juſtifying their Faith and Practice, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming peace unto them, <hi>John</hi> 20.19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Accordingly did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> practiſe by the Spirit of Faith, who coming to <hi>Troas</hi> with his Company, abode there ſeven days, and did not aſſemble with the Diſciples there to perform Chriſt's Ordinances for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip till the firſt day of the Week: whoſe example is written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the Week the Diſciples came together to break Bread,</hi> (that is, to communicate in the Lord's Supper) as a remembrance of Chriſt's Death, who died for their Sins, and roſe the firſt day for their Juſtification. And likewiſe the Ordinance of Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commanded on the firſt Day, not to be neglected, but perform'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an odour of a ſweet-ſmelling Sacrifice to the Lord in the Church of God: and therefore are Deacons appointed to attend on that work, to gather the free-gift of the Saints then caſt into the Lord's Treaſury in his Spiritual Temple of living ſtones, that the Deacons may according to the Wiſdom of God given them, diſtribute it to the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and relief of the poor Saints. Now then, if God's way is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, as it is the beſt: then the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould diſdain to be maintain'd with Pope <hi>Paſcalis</hi> his Proviſion, Tithes, which he appointed for his Maſſing Prieſts, in the Year of our Lord 827. as Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> in his Book entituled <hi>the Reliques of Rome,</hi> makes appear. For, before that time, all true Miniſters of Chriſt were fed of the Flock they fed, and drank of the Vineyard they dreſſed. Therefore let not ſuch ſay they are Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that take Antichriſt's wages: foraſmuch as the Lord Chriſt, who walketh in the midſt of his Church, is Lord and Lawgiver to the ſame. From whoſe Throne we may hear his Voice ſaying, <hi>Behold, I make all things new;</hi> a new People, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. new Ordinances, new Miniſtry, new Maintenance, new Time. And therefore is the firſt Day of the Week rightly call'd the Lord's Day by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Sabbath. As doth alſo appear further:</p>
            <p>For, as the next immediate time after the Lord had finiſhed the work of the old Creation was the ſeventh day ſanctified, a Day of holy Reſt for the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108372:26"/>Service and Worſhip of God: Even ſo the next immediate time after the Lord Jeſus had finiſhed the new Creation, or Man's Redemption by his Reſurrection, was the firſt. Day of the Week ſanctified a Day of holy Reſt, by the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, with the Churches: whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all things they joyntly practiſed with the Churches, as they did keep the <hi>firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>Week</hi> for the Goſpel-Sabbath, are ſufficient Commands for all Chriſtians to follow: becauſe it is written, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1. And again, <hi>Be ye followers together of me; and mark them which walk ſo, as you have us for an Enſample,</hi> Phil. 3.18. So that all things the Apoſtles joyntly practiſed with the Churches are exemplary Commands to bind us to follow them, but they did joyntly with the Churches keep the firſt Day of the Week to be the Goſpel-Sabbath in performing with the Churches the Ordinances ordained by Chriſt for his Worſhip. So that it is further written, <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or Spiritual; let him acknowledge, that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord. But if any man be ignorant</hi> [of this] <hi>let him be ignorant,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.37, 38.</p>
            <p>Yet that the firſt Day of the Week is the Goſpel-Sabbath, is confirmed by a ſecond Reaſon.</p>
            <p>That as the Light was created in the firſt Day, with which the Lord deck'd the World as with a Garment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2. Unto which Work of the Lord in the firſt Day, is the Spiritual Light compared by the Apoſtle in the new Creation; as it is written 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>God, who ſaid that out of Darkneſs Light ſhould ſhine, hath ſhined in our hearts. That they that once were in Darkneſs might be made light in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5.8. And thus on the firſt Day of the Week, by Chriſt's Reſurrection was Life and Immortality brought to light by the Goſpel, in the glad tidings of Chriſt's Reſurrection, who was riſen for the Juſtification of thoſe he died for. Therefore is it a Day of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Joy to all ſuch as are made Partakers thereof, never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but to be kept in holy remembrance of God's Love to Man in Chriſt, and in performing Chriſt's Ordinances, in which the Love of God in Chriſt ſhineth, and is evidently ſet forth unto them. And thus much to convince them that ſay, Chriſt hath not appointed any particular Time for his Goſpel-Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The next Place to anſwer the ſeventh day Sabbath Keepers Argument for the ſeventh Day in oppoſition to the firſt Day, who ſay, The ſeventh Day Sabbath is not aboliſhed, becauſe it was commanded to be kept by a Moral Precept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though the ſeventh Day was commanded to be kept by a Moral Precept; ſo likewiſe the Ordinances for the Worſhip of God, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and chiefly performed on the ſeventh Day, were commanded by a like Moral Precept in the ſecond Commandment. And as the Ordinances
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108372:26"/>for Worſhip then, all chriſtians grant are now aboliſhed by Chriſt, though commanded by a Moral Precept, being Figures of good things to come by Chriſt: Even ſo by the like reaſon the ſeventh Day Sabbath, figuring reſt in Chriſt, is aboliſhed by Chriſt, though commanded to be kept by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precept. So though the Ceremonial Ordinances with the Time under the Law are ended, yet the Spiritual Equity remaineth of both ſecond and fourth Commandments. As for Example, as the ſecond Commandment bound all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to worſhip the Living God with the Ordinances given by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and likewiſe forbid them all Inventions of Men in God's Worſhip; and all Chriſtians grant theſe Ceremonial Ordinances of the Law are aboliſhed, yet the ſecond Commandment remains binding to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now, as of old, to worſhip the living God with thoſe Ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lord Jeſus and no other, and likewiſe forbiddeth all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Men in the Worſhip of God under the Goſpel. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, though the ſeventh Day Sabbath is aboliſhed, yet the fourth Commandment remaineth binding to all Chriſtians now to keep one Day in ſeven holy to the Lord; and who ſhould appoint us which Day of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but Chriſt's Example with his Diſciples, <hi>(John</hi> 20.) and his Apoſtles; whoſe Examples (as aforeſaid) in what they joyntly practiſed with the Churches are Commands for us to follow, as is afore proved. Therefore the firſt Day is the Goſpel Sabbath. And that all the Sabbaths under the Law are ended is proved by the ſame Apoſtle to the Churches, <hi>Let no Man judg you in Meats or in Drinks, or in reſpect of an holy Day, or of the New-Moons, or of the Sabbaths; which are ſhadows of good things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.16, 17. And thus by the Day-break of the Goſpel the Shadows <hi>(Cant.</hi> 2.17.) are gone, yet not one Tittle of the Moral Law in the Spirituality thereof, is aboliſhed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17.18. As doth further appear.</p>
            <p>By the Number Seven in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were many Myſteries ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing good things in Chriſt to be fulfilled. To inſtance a few of many, as the ſprinkling of the Blood ſeven times before the Lord, ſignifying a full cleanſing of all our Sins by the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. And ſeven times ſprinkling the Leper, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.17. And ſeven days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating the Prieſts, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.8. The ſeventh Year a Year of Reſt <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.3, 4. and ſeven times ſeven Years brought the Jubile, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8, 9. And every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day was a Sabbath. All which Shadows, Chriſt the Subſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, are in him aboliſhed, and all that do believe in him are freed from the literal keeping of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs there remaineth a ſpecial Uſe from all theſe Figures to us that believe, being apprehended by Faith in Chriſt according as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Apoſtles have applied them for the Saints Uſe and Comfort. As namely, when the Altar of Burnt-Offering is mentioned in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, we are taught the Doctrine of Chriſt's Oblation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108372:27"/>So likewiſe from the Altar of Incenſe, the Doctrine of his Mediatorſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.5. So the Paſſover to the Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. Circumciſion to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. the Pillars to the Teachers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. And when the Tabernacle is mentioned, it is a ſign of God's dwelling with his People, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. Alſo the Candleſticks ſignify the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. And ſo likewiſe the 7th-day-Sabbath to our Reſt in Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. From all which Shadows and many more we may draw ſpiritual Comfort; foraſmuch as our Faith is not built only on the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, but alſo upon the Doctrine of the Prophets, Chriſt being held forth to be the chief Corner-Stone in both, as they are expounded by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And ſo, if the Lord open the Eyes of our Underſtanding, (as he did his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45.) we ſhall behold the wondrous things in God's Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. Therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> beginning at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in all the Prophets, expounded the Scriptures in all things concerning himſelf: which until the vail be taken away from off the eyes and heart, none can ſteadfaſtly look to the end of that which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. neither do underſtand how <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. yet not one tittle uſeleſs, but all Scripture is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; able to make the Man of God perfect in all underſtanding in the myſtery of the ſame, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.) as in that myſtery why <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be honoured above all other Prophets, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of God himſelf: Becauſe the Law of Shadows was given by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> from God, therefore God would have the Shadows of his Son honourably buried by the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who buried all Shadows in the Law with the time, himſelf reſting in the grave the whole time of the ſeventh-day Sabbath; ſo buried all <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Shadows in the Law. And therefore in this ſenſe is it written, <hi>The Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Christ. So that by Grace we are ſaved</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>and not by the works of the Law,</hi> as the ſeventh-day Keepers expect in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, A form of words, ſaying, <hi>Remember to keep holy the firſt day,</hi> as it was ſaid in the Law, to keep the <hi>ſeventh day.</hi> Theſe, with <hi>Thomas,</hi> are weak in the Faith, that muſt feel by the ſenſe of Nature before they will believe, and ſo remain under the Curſe, and not the Bleſſing, by exerciſing Faith, and not reſting on the letter of the Law, in expecting a literal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in the Goſpel for all our belief and practice; and ſo make the Goſpel a ſecondary Law of Works, when all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to ſtand on a better foundation, and to know that the things chiefly neceſſary to be ſpecified in the New Teſtament were the exhibiting the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the fleſh for the redemption of his People, with the manner of his Birth, Life, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Suffering, Death, Burial, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right-hand of God; with the calling of the Gentiles to the Faith, with their Infants to be fellow-heirs with the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108372:27"/>children; foraſmuch as the Promiſes in the Prophets belonged to them, with the aboliſhing the Ordinances with the time in the Law in the literal performance as aforeſaid; and now to follow the footſteps and examples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who have eſtabliſhed by their practices in the Churches new Ordinances, new Miniſters, Maintenance, Time and Place for Goſpel-Worſhip, &amp;c. as we have proved before; and that the Apoſtles, with the Churches, did keep the firſt-day of the week for Goſpel-Worſhip; ſo did the Chriſtians ſome hundreds of years after, as is ſhewed in <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 111. <hi>Ignatius in Epiſtola ad Magnes,</hi> after the Sabbath, or ſetting aſide the Sabbath (as ſome tranſlate it) <hi>Let every one that loves Chriſt, keep holy the Lord's Day, the Queen of Days, the Reſurrection day, the higheſt of all Days.</hi> Anno 150. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> Apol. 2. ſaith, <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Lords Day the Lord always rains Manna from Heaven, namely, the heavenly Truth of the Word read and preached to the People.</hi> All which Teſtimonies and many more ſhew, that the Chriſtians before <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time did keep the firſt Day for the Goſpel-Sabbath; and not, as ſome have ſaid, that the firſt Day was not kept till <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time; which is a groſs Miſtake; for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did not reign till about the Year of our Lord, 316.</p>
            <p>And becauſe, as is likely, the firſt Day then, as now among Chriſtians, was prophaned with Mens corrupt Minds, in doing their worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and neglect of God's Service; therefore did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor, as our King hath now, ſign an Act, or Edict, for the better keeping, or reſtraining Abuſes in Civil things on the Lord's Day; yet the Edict in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time did not, any more than this Act in our time doth, prove by its then ſetting forth, that the Lord's Day was not kept before; as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors afore named ſhew before <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> time, and in our Days before the Act came forth, the Lord's Day was kept holy, a <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the Lord, though by many much prophaned.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee how greatly ſome that go by the Name of <hi>Seventh-Day Men</hi> are miſtaken, to ſay, that the firſt Day of the VVeek was not kept for Goſpel-VVorſhip till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:108372:28"/>
            <p>Moreover, though the ſeventh Day in the fourth Commandment is aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the firſt Day come in the place; yet the Holineſs remains to the firſt as it did to the ſeventh Day, by virtue of the fourth Commandment. As for Example, If the ſame Scriptures in the Law commandeth the Worſhippers under the Goſpel, to be <hi>holy as God is holy,</hi> becauſe the Covenant by which the Lord was a Husband to them was holy, 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Levit. 11.44. Then the ſame Scriptures that commanded the Time for Worſhip under the Law, commands the Time for Goſpel-Worſhip to be kept now holy under the Goſpel, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as there was a Time when the Seventh-day Sabbath did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; ſo there is a Time when the Goſpel-Sabbath taketh its beginning. And becauſe many People in divers Nations differ much about the <hi>Time,</hi> as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> kept the firſt Day from Evening to Evening, as the <hi>Jews</hi> kept their Sabbath; the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> begin the time at Sun-riſing, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> at Noon; but moſt People in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of the World keep the firſt Day from Midnight to Midnight, which moſt agreeth with the time of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; who lying in the Grave the whole Seventh-day Sabbath, roſe moſt likely ſo ſoon as the ſeventh Day ended, becauſe then the firſt Day began with the Sun-riſing, for it riſeth to us after twelve a clock. So Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs is ſaid to be riſen very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while it was yet dark, <hi>John</hi> 20.1. So then the Seventh-day Sabbath was paſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.1. at the riſing of the Sun, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. For it may be ſaid the Sun is riſen after twelve a clock, as we call it Morning at one a clock, about which time our Goſpel-Sabbath takes its beginning, and endeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time; as <hi>Paul</hi> upon an extraordinary occaſion continued his Preaching, with the Performing of the reſt of Chriſt's Ordinances, till twelve a Clock of the Firſt Day of the Week at Night, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7.</p>
            <p>And as the time being changed to the firſt Day with the Holineſs thereof, even ſo by the virtue of the fourth Commandment are we alſo forbidden all manner of Work on the firſt Day, as was forbidden on the ſeventh Day of old. As ſaith the Prophet, <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a Delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, not doing thy one pleaſures, nor ſpeaking thy own words,</hi> Iſa. 58.13. <hi>Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> ver. 14. But it is much to be feared, that Goſpel Profeſſors are not acquainted with this Scripture, when on the firſt Day of the Week they can work in their Trade apart, ſome all day; ſome carry home Work, ſell Wares, write Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of worldly Buſineſs, ride Journies, make Bargains, and caſt up their Books of Accompts, take Voyage to Sea. Let all ſuch know, that <hi>becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8 11. God will puniſh the Breakers of this Time for Goſpel-Worſhip, as he did the Breakers of the Seventh-day Sabbath under the Law.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:108372:28"/>
            <p>Moreover, If the Lord made it a ſpecial Reaſon, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old ſhould keep the Seventh day Sabbath upon their Deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> on which Day it may be ſuppoſed they came out, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. Sure our Spiritual Deliverance from the Spiritual Bondage of Sin and Satan, of which Bondage <hi>Aegypt</hi> was a Figure, is therefore a more weightier reaſon, why we ſhould keep the Day of our Deliverance, even the firſt Day of the Week, the Day wherein the Redemption of all the Elect was accompliſhed by Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead. And again if <hi>Iſrael</hi> were enjoyned to keep the Seventh-day upon their Deliverance; how much more are all Chriſtians bound upon the ſame Ground and Reaſons to keep the Day of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>And again, If the bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was ſuch a Work, as God for the memorial thereof, made both the Day and Month the Beginning and firſt Month of the Year, which was not ſo before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. and the Deliverance (as afore) but a Figure of our Spiritual; How much more then is that Day to be accounted of, and kept holy above all Days in the Year, in which we were delivered from our Spiritual Bondage by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, who ſuffered on that day that Sin was firſt committed in Paradiſe; and alſo after he had ſuffered for Sin, lay in the Grave the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath, the chief time that the Sacrifice for Sin was conſumed on the Altar. And thus when the holy Scriptures, which conſiſt of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Hiſtories, Parables, Myſteries, Statutes, Judgments, and the like, are rightly (as ſaith the Apoſtle) divided, we may not be aſhamed, as ſome whom he blamed, that deſired to be Teachers of the Law, underſtanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm, keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath for the Goſpel-Sabbath, mingling the Law and Goſpel together, either in our Juſtification before God, and likewiſe in practice by keeping the Letter of the Law in the Seventh-day Sabbath, as the only Time for Goſpel-Worſhip; ſo making the Lord Jeſus in his Church inferior to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, Having given this brief obſervation of the ſtate of the Church of Chriſt from his Aſcenſion to the end of the World; with the Confeſſion of Faith in which the Primitive Churches were eſtabliſhed; and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Order they performed all the Ordinances of Chriſt, with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Maintenance, and Time: Let the <hi>Reader</hi> wiſely obſerve, that in this laſt Age of the World we are told that after the laſt glorious Reformation under the ſeventh Angel, (as is deſcribed in the Preface) Satan will be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of his Reſtraint (or Priſon) again; and becauſe he knows he hath but a ſhort time, will gather together his Armies, comprehended under the name of <hi>Gog and Magog, Rev.</hi> 20. whoſe names ſignify <hi>covered,</hi> or <hi>to cover,</hi> (to wit) <hi>but not with my Spirit,</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1.) but with his Angelick Doctrines, as if they came from Heaven: So will he uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108372:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſleights to deceive, as Chriſt ſaith, if it were poſſible the very Elect, by his falſe Apoſtles and Prophets, with their vain titles and gilded ſhews of Church and Miniſtry: So that the Harlot, or falſe Church, called a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is ſaid to have Horns, like the Lamb <hi>Chriſt, Rev.</hi> 13.11. yea ſhe is ſaid to be arrayed with Purple and Scarlet, gilded with Gold, precious Stones, and Pearls, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4. as if ſhe were the Queen and Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.9, 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.10, 13. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.5. She hath Peace-offerings and Vows, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14. as if ſhe were the very Church of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.13. Bread and Water to refreſh her Children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.16, 17. and her number great and many, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. yet but a well-favoured Harlot, <hi>Nah.</hi> 3.4. who by her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring tongue, whereby ſhe lieth in wait to deceive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Rom:</hi> 16.18. hath caſt down many wounded, yea many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her; for her houſe is the way to Hell, going down to the Chambers of Death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.26, 27. Therefore what ſpecial care ought every one to have that tender their ſouls eternal happineſs, to examine what eſtate they are in, and whether the Congregation they are members of be the true Church of God, ſeeing in theſe laſt days Chriſt telleth us, that many falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and deceive many.</p>
            <p>Now if in Nature we were warned of theſe dangers and harms to the Body, what ſtrong watch would we ſet at our gates both night and day to prevent it? how much more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned by theſe Lines, of the dangers of theſe laſt and perilous days, wherein ſo many unſtable ſouls are beguiled, that never try by God's Word what they hear; but if it ſuit with the natural ſenſe, it is yeelded to for a Truth, when as the natural man cannot judg in matters of Faith, ſeing he perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; and ſo upon this falſe ground is the whole Goſpel of Chriſt perverted, and made a ſecondary Law of works, that if men believe as the general part of the Church believes, it is true belief; and if they go to hear a Sermon, and ſometimes break Bread, it is all the ſervice God requires of them in the Church or Congregation: Let us intreat ſuch not thus to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or any longer be led away by Deceivers, to think if they imitate a part of God's ſervice, or without Faith in what they do, they are in a good condition: Let ſuch know the contrary: for <hi>Cain</hi> as well as <hi>Abel</hi> offered ſacrifice, yet were not both accepted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their Apoſtacy erected a Temple, an Altar and Miniſtry, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. And did not the two women plead both conſidently for the living Child, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.16. and whoſe could it be but hers that loved it moſt: Even ſo, who is the true Church of Chriſt but they that love him moſt? and who are thoſe Churches that love Chriſt moſt, but they that keep all his Commandments? as it is written, <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,</hi> Joh. 14.21. But how ſhall ſuch Churches be ſaid to love Chriſt, that ſhut out of his Church or Kingdom his true Miniſtry, and alſo the performance of ſeveral of his Ordinances? For proof thereof we refer the <hi>conſcienable Reader</hi> that will judg without partiality, comparing the practice of the Church in this day, and their faith, to the primitive practice that we the poor deſpiſed Chriſtians, falſly called <hi>Brownists,</hi> have here ſet down as our Belief and Practice; deſiring the Lord in his mercy to bleſs theſe our Labours to this Generation, even the elect among them, that they ſeeing their Lords plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, may flee to him whom they love in his true Church, as Doves to their windows, <hi>Iſae.</hi> 60.8. Now to him that is able to keep us from falling, even the only wiſe God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be all Glory, Honour and Praiſe rendred now, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
